# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Create two shooting stars in Khan Academy Project Shooting Star. Started removing code from portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** Trying to do some JavaScript animations today. The biggest issue was trying to get the stars to go into different directions. Most of the time the stars just wanted to go in the same direction. I revisited the previous lessons and took several attempts at tweaking the xPos and yPos for the different stars to get them to go into different directions. I revisited my portfolio site and started removing some of the div tags in my code for the full-width, half-width, and third-width. I made some tweaks to the head tag such as the Google fonts link and style tags. I did create an assets folder to move my stylesheets and images to live in for the project. I'm not quite sure how to tackle the portfolio site quite yet so I need to wireframe my website before I tackle more code tomorrow.

### Day 2: June 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Build Animal Attack Project in Khan Academy. Create animal with more JS animations. Added div tags to portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** Did more practice with JavaScript animations today. I made an animal in the Khan Academy Resizing Variables lessons. I found I was repeating code a lot often as I was putting together the animals so I went back over my code and change variables for any code I was going to repeat again. I did a little bit better job with the animations today. Originally the code in my animations was moving to the right side of the screen instead of staying in place, but I played around with the variables and numbers for the X and Y for the ellipse to keep everything in place. I started making tweaks to my portfolio website. I'm debating on adding more pages to my website and some JavaScript. I'm not sure what JavaScript to add to my website though. For now I'm going to see if I can focus on getting the HTML the way I'd like before I make bigger changes.

### Day 3: June 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Create an fictional advertisement for Khan Academy project Ad Design. Add two pages to portfolio site. Update index.html code for home page.

**Thoughts:** This project didn't have a lot of JS animations but I did add an animation as a bonus to the project to get more practice. I had an easier time getting the eyeSize variable to animate in this project. Although the mouth is still visible when the animation for the eyes is working, I am pretty proud that I was able to get the eyes animated today. The ad itself was kept very simple so I could practice using text(), draw(), and textSize(). I spend a lot of my time adjusting the x, y, w, and h when I add shapes or text. I spent the last 30 minutes working on my portfolio site. I did the wireframe last night so I'm updating the HTML code. I created two new folders for the new pages of my portfolio website and started adding code to the about page. I managed to get the navigation in the about page working. The styles are a mess, but I'll change the styles once I get all the HTML done for all three pages.

### Day 4: June 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Build fishes for Khan Academy Project Fish Tank. Add more HTML tags to About and Portfolio pages. Update navigation on all pages.

**Thoughts:** Khan Academy outlines specific steps students to do in this project, but I spent most of my time making the fish. Refactoring the code was quite easy and I got a better sense of how parameters work in JS functions this way. The only issue was getting the fish to be different colors. Initially they were all turning white when I called the drawFish function. I eventually commented out the starter code Khan Academy provided including the variables and changed the fill() to color instead of bodyColor. I eventually realized when I was calling the function, I was using "purple" instead of color(). Once I used color() and changed the rgb values, the fishes started to change colors. I added the rest of the HTML for About and Portfolio pages. I added the rest of the sections on these pages. I had to change the navigation on the pages so no errors popped up when trying to move from one page to another. I tested each page locally to see if there were any errors. I'm going to start playing with the CSS tomorrow. I created a main.css file for all the base styles. This way I don't repeat the same code all on the stylesheets.

### Day 5: June 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made a magic 8 ball for the Khan Academy project Magic 8 Ball. Fix vulnerable dependencies with Github repositories.

**Thoughts:** I made all the if-else statements for the magic 8 ball. Most of my time was spent playing around with the position of the text in the magic 8 ball. I was having a hard time getting the words centered the way I wanted in the triangle. I did start over this project twice because I was playing around with the > or < operators first then tried using the === to do each of the individual numbers. Originally I was planning on working on my portfolio website but I got an e-mail with some security vulnerabilities on a few of my repositories. So I used the time to do some googling to see how to fix them with the Github documentation and help.

### Day 6: June 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made a house in Khan Academy's Build a House project. Added bushes to the house.

**Thoughts:** The house project was a bit tougher than I was planning. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to get the windows to repeat on the house. I tried using a variable at first, but that wasn't working. I realized the fill() and rect() need to be inside the for loop, but I wasn't sure how to get them to repeat on the site. I figured I had to use the i somewhere in the rect() but I wasn't 100% sure if this was the right way of thinking. I did some googling and found some videos of people doing the same project. One of the videos was using the same method I was thinking about using. I was planning on making grass, but I spent a lot of time trying to get the triangles to look the exact shape I wanted. So I just used two rect() to make bushes instead. Started to work on the CSS for my portfolio. I was going to use a fourth stylesheet for the base styles but I decided it might get too confusing so I deleted the main.css file. I did start making some changes to the mobile.css and have some of the styles added to the home page. I spent a lot of time trying to get my Google Fonts to work. Tomorrow I'd like to play with the images on the mobile site to see if I can find the right size for them or find a position for them.

### Day 7: June 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Create rain drops for Khan Academy project Make it Rain. Added mobile CSS styles to home and about pages.

**Thoughts:** This has been the toughest JS project I've done for Khan Academy. Making the arrays for the rain droplets were easy. However I wasn't sure how to go about getting the rain drops to get back to the top. After trying different for loops, I searched YouTube to see what other devs have done. Amy Prosser's tutorials helped quite a lot. After using her tips, I played around with the code a bit to see how different numbers in the array worked and trying to see if I could get the raindrops to change color. I added more CSS styles to home and about pages. I played with the image sizes on the home page as best as I could, but I decided to make things bigger than I planned so they stand out on a mobile screen. The padding for the social media icons wasn't work very well. The padding made the icons move onto another row or go too far over to the left even when I tried to make spaces between them. I decided to just leave them the way they are for now. I just need to make some final tweaks to the about page's mobile css then I'm going to tackle the portfolio tomorrow.

### Day 8: June 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made three books on a bookshelf for Khan Academy project Bookshelf.

**Thoughts:** This was a good exercise to get practice with on JS objects. Making the objects were easy. However I had trouble getting the books to appear on the bookshelf. After spending sometime playing with the for loop, I did some googling and used another Amy Prosser video to see what I was doing wrong. It turns out that I wasn't using the variables I made correctly. I needed to add them to the x and y positions then multiply them by 100 to get them to appear on the shelf and get the stars to appear. I tried changing the colors of the books, but I didn't have much luck since I kept getting errors trying to use the fill(). So I decided to just skip the color property for the books. I added the remaining CSS styles for the About page. I added h3 tags on the portfolio page for projects and changed the p tags into ul tags for projects. Most of the time was spent on getting the mobile CSS done. I removed CSS flexbox and checked everything in Dev Tools. So far everything is working fine without it. I started updating the responsive CSS for the home page. Right now the headers are not appearing on the page so I'll play with it more tomorrow and see if I can get it to appear on my site.

### Day 9: June 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Change some of the CSS styles in mobile style sheet. Add more CSS styles for responsive CSS style sheet so all HTML pages work on tablets. Began working on styles for the desktop version of my portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** I made some small changes to the mobile style sheet so I wasn't repeating a lot of code. Most of the time was spent on updating my portfolio's responsive style sheet. I can't get the navigation to look quite like I was planning so I visited my current portfolio site and realized I faced similar issues with the current version. So I'm leaving the navigation the way it is now and trying to update the rest of the styles for the site. So far responsive site preview I'm seeing in dev tools is looking quite similar to what I'm seeing on the mobile version of my website. I might play with the font sizes to see if I can make things bigger for the tablet version. I started to work on the styles for the desktop version of my website. My career compass section was indented when I added the padding to the navigation. I tried playing around with the padding, but it remained indented. I finally changed the height size of the header and everything moved into the right place.

### Day 10: June 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Adding more CSS styles to the desktop portfolio site. Change font sizes for the mobile version of site.

**Thoughts:** I'm not happy with the font size on my portfolio site. I might play around with the font sizes once I get all the pages updated. Many of the elements are floating in the wrong places so I changed some of the heights of sections which resolved the problem. This isn't the case with the portfolio page. One of the projects it still floating in the wrong place despite these changes. I changed some of the div tags to see if the names were correct but things didn't improve. I eventually found a solution by creating separate full-width div tags for each project. I also created a project class for the div tags change the height and bottom padding for each project. I played around with the font sizes for the mobile CSS. Tomorrow I'm going to play around with the font sizes for the responsive and desktop CSS style sheets.

### Day 11: June 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add buttons to Portfolio page. Tweak CSS on pages.

**Thoughts:** Still updating all the CSS on the portfolio site. Some of the sections on the desktop pages were indented so I played around the CSS such as the padding and height. I removed some of the styles I had added previously. Biggest addition were the buttons for the portfolio page. I set up a script file for the entire site and added the link to all index files. I set up a script file for JavaScript and added jQuery to my website. I didn't work much with the JavaScript since I was looking at the documentation for JavaScript and jQuery to see what would the best way moving forward with making the button. At the moment jQuery seems like the best option but I think I'm going to try just using regular JavaScript to get it to work. I found one answer on StackOverflow that I've started. I'm going to test it with one of the blog buttons to see if it works. If it doesn't, I'll google to see if I find another way.

### Day 12: June 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added onclick attribute to button tags. Create separate functions for every button's onclick attribute. Change sizes of icons on HTML pages. Added more sections to About and Portfolio pages.

**Thoughts:** I made more changes to the index and CSS files. I removed the jQuery links I added yesterday and change the sizes to the Font Awesome icons. I added another li tag for my Github. I used the StackOverflow method I found yesterday. I tested it with some of the buttons on my website and everything worked perfectly. I added onclick attribute to each button and created separate functions for each button. I'm not sure how else I can add JavaScript to my portfolio site so I was doing some research on MDN web docs to see what else I could do. The last 30 minutes were adding new sections to the portfolio and about pages. I went into the CSS to add more styling on these sections so they would work on all devices. I'm going to wrap up most of the coding for the portfolio tomorrow since all that is left to do is change the copy.

### Day 13: June 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Set up code files for Random Quote Machine project. Add content for Home and About pages. Tried fixing CSS issues for skills section on Home page.

**Thoughts:** I set up the code files for my next project Random Quote Machine for 30 minutes. I didn't get quite a lot of coding done on this project due to my computer running slow plus I wasn't sure if I should use React or not. I originally added React to the project, but I decided at the last minute to not use it in favor of getting more practice with basic vanilla JavaScript and some jQuery. In the CodePen I added some of the first few items from the test and made sure my files were connected. After fixing my computer, I started doing more revisions on my portfolio site. I removed some of the placeholder text to see how items would look with the real text added in there. As soon as I changed the text for the skills third-width elements, the skills summary at the bottom indented. I tried fixing it with the playing by adding padding to the skills p tags but it didn't do much. I will play around with the padding and height for the skills summary tomorrow.

### Day 14: June 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made a basic travel website for Khan Academy's Travel webpage project. Added quote array with objects inside Random Quote Machine. Made new section tag for other-skills. Change images to icons on home page.

**Thoughts:** The basic travel website isn't too fancy. I focused on doing the styling rather than making a fancy looking project. I just need to remember to watch the names of my classes and ids since I forgot to change the selectors after I changed the names for different tags. I used a little bit of time to start add more HTML to the Random Quote Machine. I added buttons for the clickable elements and started an array of quotes in my script file. I'm going to see if I can get the quotes to appear tomorrow in the quote box and name the buttons in the quote box. The last 30 minutes were making more updates and changes to my portfolio site. I removed the portfolio images and used Font Awesome icons instead. The design icon wasn't appearing on my website so I added the updated version of Font Awesome to my site. Once the style sheet was added, I started changing the padding and height to the Skills section. I decided to create a separate section for the other-skills instead of keeping in within the skills section id tag. This fixed a lot of the indenting that came from changing the padding. I made changes to the rest of the skills icons on mobile and responsive style sheets. I need to finish adding styles to the new #other-skills section on all the style sheets tomorrow.

### Day 15: June 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Changed quotes in Quote Machine. Created function for displaying quote. Added more copy to Home and Portfolio pages. Adjusted CSS for skills and other-skills sections on Home page for responsive and style files.

**Thoughts:** I decided to change directions on my quote machine project so I changed all the quotes I added yesterday. As soon as I did this, I started second guessing myself again on the quotes but decided to leave them the way they are now. I started to work on the first user story which is upon loading the machine a random quote is displayed in the text element. I managed to set up the function and create variables for the random number and random quote. However I'm wondering if I should just use a regular array for the quotes instead of objects. I did some googling and am looking in JavaScript & jQuery to read a bit more on JS objects. During the last 30 minutes I adjusted the height and padding for the skills and other-skills sections on the home page on all the style sheets. I started adding more copy to p tags on the Home page to see how this would impact the styles for the sections. It was a good thing I checked since the other-skills section indented as soon as I changed the height of the skills section. I started changing the padding on the portfolio page. This caused the elements to stack up on each other instead of being side by side. I'm going to play around with them tomorrow to see if I can improve the spacing a bit.

### Day 16: June 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Change variables in Quote Machine. Managed to get author and quotes to appear on site. Continued to play with CSS styles for portfolio page on portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** After giving things lots of thought, I decided to change directions again on the quote machine. I changed the objects to separate variables for the quotes and the authors. I was having issues getting any text to appear on my site. It turns out that I forgot the quotation marks around the ids which is why nothing was appearing. As soon as I added the quotation marks everything started to appear on the browser. I managed to get the new quote button to work. I'm not sure how to get the tweets to open so I did some googling to see what I could find. During the last 30 minutes I tried adjusting the spacing and padding for the project bullet points. I ended up adjusting the height of the sections and padding on the images to make a few improvements. I added more content to the portfolio page. I need to double check mobile and responsive pages tomorrow to see how the new content impacts the styles. I was adjusting the community section and managed to switch the two half-width sections around. I need to double check the height of these sections in the desktop file to see if the contact section doesn't indent itself.

### Day 17: June 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Trying to get tweet-quote button to work. Ran tests to see what works and still needs work on quote machine. Finish work on portfolio page on portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** Spent 30 minutes working on the tweet-quote button. Did lots of googling to just see how to get the window to open. The biggest challenge was getting the href attribute to work. So far I've managed to get the quote and the author to appear in the Tweet window. At first I kept getting undefined in the window. After looking at the Twitter Developers documentation and doing more searching on Stack Overflow, I was able to get the quote to appear. When I tried getting the quotation marks to appear, my site stopped working. I ran the tests and only one test isn't passing and that is the tweet button test. I'm going to see tomorrow if there is a better way to get the tweet button to work. During the last 30 minutes I removed ul and li tags for publications, awards and certifications. I used p tags for most of these elements. I created a brand new section for awards and added styles to all the style sheets. I changed some font sizes for li tags on my responsive style sheet so everything stayed consistent. Tomorrow I'd like to play with the padding of sections to see if I can push elements further away from the left side of the screen.

### Day 18: June 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tried getting the tweet button to work. Start adding padding and height to sections. Currently trying add height to mobile portfolio sections.

**Thoughts:** The first 30 minutes were trying to get the tweet button to work. I wasn't able to get much progress. I did read some of the forum posts for people's tweet button to see if I could have better luck. I tried using the attr() method for the link. I even created a global tweet variable to put part of the Twitter url inside. However none of my attempts worked. I'll keep googling and reading through the Free Code Camp documentation. Right now the button doesn't work at all and the tweet window doesn't even open. Luckily the other tests are still passing which means I can dedicate more time to the tweet button. The last 30 minutes were trying to get spacing for my portfolio page. I'm not 100% satisfied with the images on my mobile and responsive portfolio sites. I might remove the padding and just not make the icons centered in each section. Right now I'm working on adding height to the portfolio items in my mobile version of my portfolio site to see if it will it will help with the spacing. I'll play around with the padding for these elements tomorrow and see if I can make improve the spacing on the responsive version of my portfolio site.

### Day 19: June 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continue to work on tweet button work and pass the Free Code Camp tests. Added padding and height to responsive and main versions of portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were on getting the tweet button to work. I added back the original code I was using and began playing around with creating different functions to get them to work. It didn't work. I did more research on the Free Code Camp forums where I found about encodeURIComponent on one of the posts. I tried this with creating two variables for the text and the link. This managed to work. However the Free Code Camp tests still didn't pass. It turns out Free Code Camp wants the intent part of the URL in the href attribute on the HTML. I did more research on the Free Code Camp forums and found a method I'd like to try which adds the href attribute to a link in JavaScript. I saved the link to read tomorrow in my code and will try using the attr() again to see how it works. Last 30 minutes were updating styles for the responsive and desktop versions of the website. I just need to make some small changes to the portfolio page's award section on the main style sheet then portfolio updates will be done. I checked all versions of my site on Dev Tools and was getting mixed results when I looked at specific versions of the site. My responsive site initially didn't fill the entire screen. It would stay like this even when I refreshed the page. However when I exited out of Dev Tools and reopened it, it went back to the version I saw yesterday. I'll need to double check all versions of my site tomorrow before it goes live on the web.

### Day 20: June 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Build a recipe book for Khan Academy project. Made final tweaks to the portfolio site. Got the tweet button to work and pass tests.

**Thoughts:** In the first 30 minutes I began building a recipe book for one of the Khan Academy HTML projects. I made a very basic version of this site on the Khan Academy platform. I spent a lot time trying organizing my HTML tags. I decided to add section tags to organize the recipes a little bit better. The lesson limited a lot of the styling I could do on the page so I might make a better version someday later. The last few minutes of this session were doing the final tweaks on my portfolio site. Now that is done, I have now made everything live on my site. Last 30 minutes were figuring out the tweet button. I read the article I saved in the pen and tried it in my code. It didn't work so I went back into the forums to see I could get more help. I tried my theory with the tweet intent URL in the HTML and strangely all my tests passed this way but the button didn't work. It took a few minutes, but I finally figured it out. I used what I originally planned which was putting the tweet intent link in a variable. I then used the attr() method to set the href attribute then created the URL with the tweet intent, randomQuote and randomAuthor variables. This made the last test pass. All I have left to do is add styles to the page. I'm going to play with the Bootstrap tomorrow.

### Day 21: June 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to add CSS styles to the Quote Machine. Add more HTML tags to organize code.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were adding styles. I managed to get the fonts changed. I was trying out some of the Bootstrap classes to see if they could get the quote and author side by side for a few minutes. Bootstrap isn't one of my favorite things to work with in code since my project always looks different depending on the screen size so I find myself regularly looking at the page in several sizes to see how everything looks. I added an h3 and img tags for parts of my header. I organized the HTML with header and main tags. I spent some time trying to figuring out the sizing of the quote box but decided to play around with the height first and get the header organized the way I want before moving to the quote box. I tried centering the image with some of the Bootstrap documentation but found I was having better luck with the padding. In the last 30 minutes, I added the Twitter icon to the tweet button and make other final tweaks to the project. This included adding a footer at the bottom of the page and adding color. I tried putting some spacing between the new quote and tweet buttons for the mobile version. However the changes weren't showing up on Dev Tools when I checked the iphone preview. For now I'm going to leave it the way it is now but perhaps someday I'll go back into the project to change it. The style of this project is kept very simple. I thought about adding quotation marks around the quotes on the page but decided to leave it the way it is. When I ran final tests, the tweet button test failed. When I ran the tests again a couple more times, all the tests passed. While playing around with the page, it turns out that the tweet quote button just keeps showing the same quote even if the text on the page is showing a different quote. Tomorrow I'll see if I can fix the issue and get the button to reset the quote each time the new quote button is clicked.

### Day 22: June 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fix tweet button on quote machine project so tweets change with new quote.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes was just trying to use tips from the Free Code Camp forums to fix the tweet quote issue. Right now when you click the tweet button the window opens to show the quote that was on the page when the button was first clicked. If the quote changes, the tweet won't change when the button is clicked and still shows the quote from the first time the button is clicked. So far I've not been able to find much advice on the Free Code Camp forums for this issue. Right now I'm trying to use a function and create separate variables based on a method I saw in the forums. I have a second method I used during the last 30 minutes. This method involved using a widget but it didn't work. I found a complicated method in the Free Code Camp forums that went back to using the encodeURIComponent method. At first it didn't work. I kept being taken to another page saying there was an error. However this was due to me using some of the variables I used from a previous attempt. Once I changed the variables, everything began working. Right now the tweet button is working again. I am thinking about adding quotation marks around the quote in the tweet tomorrow to see how that works. My biggest issue is the testing. My tests were failing at first for the new-quote button and the tweet button. Yet running the tests again passed everything. Tomorrow I'll use sometime run through the tests and double check everything.

### Day 23: June 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Ran tests on quote machine. Added quotation marks inside textToTweet variable for quote machine. Set up pen and files for Markdown Previewer. Set up code files for sample portfolio site. Started adding HTML to the sample portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were doing final testing on the quote machine. When the tests run right when the page starts, only 11/12 tests pass. One situation had 10/12 tests passing. It seems when the buttons aren't pressed, the tests failed. However after testing the buttons and running the Free Code Camp tests, all 12 tests passed. It seems that the tests will fail if the buttons aren't used but will work when they do. After running several tests, I decided to leave my code since they all met the user stories. I might revisit this project in the future to see if I can get the tests the first time without any issues. The rest of that 30 minute session was getting the Markdown Previewer project set up. I admit I'm confused at what this project is about. So I might play around with the example project Free Code Camp has to just get an idea what they want me to build. I think this is a good project to use React so I spent some time just reading the documentation on the React site to make sure I'm setting things up correctly. I managed to add two HTML tags on the Markdown Previewer but I don't feel inspired building this project since I'm not sure what I'm suppose to build. For the second 30 minute session I decided to redo some of the sites I've been making for 30 Days, 30 Sites to do alongside the Free Code Camp projects. I was feeling overwhelmed and confused with the project overview for the Markdown Previewer so I thought the 30 Days, 30 Sites project would help me clear my head plus create projects to show as examples for a coding challenge I'm creating. First few minutes in this session were just getting everything organized and doing the setup. I've got a good start on the HTML code and have some of the tags added. I will try finishing the HTML tomorrow. My goal for the 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio is to get a better sense of Bootstrap and getting it to work on mobile devices so I'll be focusing more on Bootstrap with this portfolio than the portfolio site I just made updates on.

### Day 24: June 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add more HTML code to the Markdown Previewer. Finished set up on Markdown Previewer. Add more HTML to 30 days 30 sites portfolio site. Began adding CSS styles.

**Thoughts:** After yesterday's session I played around with other people's markdown previewers including the Free Code Camp example to get a better understanding how the project works. This helped me get a better idea of what I will be building. I did add some more HTML tags to the Markdown Previewer. Some of the tags will just be reference for what when I'm building so they won't be in the project the entire time. The first 30 minutes were really just trying to get react set up on CodePen correctly. This took more time than I anticipated since I added some of the wrong links for React in CodePen so I double checked the documentation to make sure I was doing it right. I didn't start a lot of the JavaScript yet. My goal tomorrow is to just make sure everything is connected before I even start trying to figure out the user stories. During the last 30 minutes I added more HTML to the 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio site. I added Google Fonts and Font Awesome. I did start some of the CSS styles but some of my text isn't changing. I'm going to double check my style sheet links tomorrow when I start adding more styles. I also would like to play around with the layout and start putting together the different versions of this website to see what Bootstrap classes I can use.

### Day 25: June 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made sure React was connected to pen. Started using some of the React documentation. Remove contact section from 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio site. Began adding CSS styles to portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** The React documentation lied. The setup took me way longer than a minute to set up. It turns out the HTML code I had added earlier was throwing off everything in React. So I changed around classes and removed most of the original code I added a few days ago. As soon as I changed the classes to ids and removed all the extra code, everything slowly started working. I spent the first 30 minutes just trying to get "Hello World" to appear so I mostly was troubleshooting all the errors from the setup. So I was mostly reading the documentation and using the documentation sample code to just get "Hello World" to appear. Once "Hello World" appeared, I started a bit of work trying to get the first user story done. Last 30 minutes were adding styles for the 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio page. I figured out why my fonts weren't appearing on my site. It turns out I used font-size instead of font-family. I didn't work too much with the HTML today but I did remove the contact section at the bottom. I began adding styles. I spent a lot of time trying to change the color of jumbotron. Tomorrow I'm going to play around with the header's container class to see if I can add a background color for the header. Once I've got most of the styles done, I want to use the time to start playing around with the Bootstrap classes to see how everything looks on different mobile devices.

### Day 26: June 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made an HTML & CSS blog for Khan Academy Project Blog. Create a React Component for Markdown Previewer. Added more CSS styles and Bootstrap classes to 30 Days, 30 Sites Portfolio.

**Thoughts:** First 10 minutes were building a project for a Khan Academy course. Building this project keeps getting me thinking about building my very own blog site. The Khan Academy version is very simple since the project is meant to give users practice with font-family, font-style, and line-height. Working on this project was simple, but I was thinking throughout the process of building my own blog site again. Once the blog site was finished, I spent the rest of the first 30 minute session working on the Markdown Previewer. Most of this time was starting to set up the React Component. I didn't do a lot of coding since I was reading the documentation on React and looking at posts on StackOverflow. I realized that the best way to start user story one is creating a form. So in the render() I began setting up the form for the editor and preview areas. I did manage to find some documentation on the ReactJS site for textarea tag. I'm going to try the documentation's example tomorrow and see how I can customize it to be the editor for this project. The last 30 minutes were making more CSS updates to the 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio. I added some more CSS for the highlights and footer sections. Today I went back to HTML to start playing around with the Bootstrap classes. Right now I'm working on the mobile version of my portfolio site. So far everything isn't looking all over the place like most of my previous Bootstrap projects. All I need to do is finish the footer then I'll move onto styling the responsive tablet version of this portfolio. I just need to add the float property to the footer.

### Day 27: June 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added React Component to Markdown Previewer then deleted it. Spent time troubleshooting React Component render method. Attempted to fix footer. Added navbar to 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** The textarea documentation wasn't working for me. After finishing the documentation, I wasn't getting any results. I kept looking at the React documentation, but I also looked at a couple of YouTube videos just to double check my setup. I thought my original HTML was throwing off my code so I deleted it. It turns out that I was writing JSX wrong the entire time especially in the render method. I kept getting an error message in CodePen throughout today's session. Originally I was using h1 and h2 tags inside the render element and the error message saying adjacent tags must be wrapped in enclosing tags. After several attempts, the error message finally turned off as soon as I changed the h1 and h2 tags into div tags. I decided to just keep the header tags just in the HTML and concentrate on building the react inside the render(). In the last 30 minutes, I played around with the footer in the 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio site. I wasn't able to accomplish my vision yet for the footer. I need to use row class on some of my elements to get them in a row. I will try that tomorrow. I didn't work on the mobile version of the portfolio today. I saw Colt Steele using Bootstrap to make a navbar in an app when I was working on my coding tutorials and I wanted to try it for this project. So most of my time was spent looking at the Bootstrap documentation and getting a navbar at the top of the page. I removed the jumbotron classes and some of the header styles but I have a start on the navbar. I just need to figure out how to get the nav links to line up besides each other just like in the documentation instead on top of each other. Once the navbar is finished, I'll go back to working on getting the site on different screen sizes.

### Day 28: June 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Solved user stories 3 and 4 for Markdown Previewer. Added some basic CSS to previewer to see what I'm working with. Finished working on header navbar on 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio. Add row classes to header, highlights, and footer.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were working on getting the editor to show text and for the previewer to show the results. I did use some documentation and Ben Brooke's YouTube tutorial to help. My biggest issue was the editor disappearing as I was working. As I was working, my editor and preview kept trying to disappear as I as working in the JS file. I put the container element inside a div tag and everything stayed on a page. I forgot an underscore when I was setting the dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute for the preview editor. This gave me more errors in CodePen. I also need to remember when working with React I can use self closing tags. While reading the documentation and watching Ben's video, I noticed some of the divs and textarea tags could be used as self closing tags. Right now my tags in React have opening and closing tags but I'll have to remember for future React projects to try some of the self closing tags. During the last 30 minutes, I finished working on the navbar. I rearranged some of the nav classes and added a div with the row class. This got everything on the navbar lined up. However the headline and navigation items seem very close. I tried using justify-content-end to see if this would right align the list items while I float the items right. It didn't work. The items just stayed in the same place. I decided to just leave them the way they are now so I can concentrate on other areas of the portfolio. I added more div tags with the row class to highlights and footer. Initially the highlights items weren't in a row. This was due to the classes I was using for the columns. Once I changed the columns from col-xs to col the elements lined up nice and neatly in a row. Tomorrow I will play around with the column sizes so everything doesn't look so cramped on the page.

### Day 29: June 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Trying to solve user story 5 for Markdown Previewer. Set markdown for elements in the user story. Add overflow property to previewer. Update highlights section for 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio page. Add headline and new div class. Fix footer.

**Thoughts:** I spent 30 minutes trying to solve the fifth user story for the Markdown Previewer. Right now the test is failing. I have been using Ben Brooke's tutorial and doing some googling for documentation to see what I'm doing wrong. I'm not having much luck. Right now the list markdowns are what are being addressed in the error message. Tomorrow I'm going to read through the list documentation to see what I'm doing wrong. I'll still check the rest of the markdowns to make sure they pass but the tests are pointing to the lists items so I'll see what I can find on Google. But I enjoyed learning about the markdown documentation. I'll definitely have to try out some of the markdowns in the future when I get a chance. The last 30 minutes were more work on the 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio page. I fixed the footer by changing the column sizes. I played around mostly with the highlights section of the portfolio site. I added a headline Latest Posts and an h4 tag for the dates of each posts. I removed the video I added earlier and replaced the p tags with images. I did add some styling to these elements but most of the style changes were adding padding and height properties. I did add some styles to the navbar at the top of the header such as changing the colors, adding a background color. Most importantly I removed a container class the navbar and headline were wrapped around so it would extend the entire container just like the footer. Tomorrow I'm going to fix the padding for the images in the highlights and do some final style changes for the footer before I start seeing how the site looks on different screen sizes.

### Day 30: June 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fix issue with the list markdown for the Markdown Previewer. Pass tests for optional user stories. Start adding styles and Bootstrap classes to 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio so it can work responsively.

**Thoughts:** During the first 30 minutes, I managed to get all the functionality for the Markdown Previewer done. I did some more googling and used the Ben Brooke's YouTube tutorial to help me. It turns out that I forgot a space between the text and the hyphen. As soon as I put a space, the previewer showed bullet points for the list items and the tests passed. The rest of the time was spent trying to get the optional tests to passed. I felt kind of silly about the break testing since I spent a lot of time googling how to use JavaScript to render carriage returns into line breaks when all along there Marked.js documentation how to do it in a much simpler way. I was on the right track with the renderer object. I initially tried using inside marked.setOptions. However Ben Brooke's method was much easier which involved creating a renderer variable then creating a function which sets the renderer's link and target attributes. All the mandatory tests pass and the optional ones pass as well now so I just need to focus on styling the page. The last 30 minutes were making changes to the 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio site. I took a few minutes to play around with the padding for the highlights images and footer. Most of the time was spent on seeing how the site worked different screen sizes. This mean playing with the Bootstrap classes and seeing how they looked in Dev Tools. I managed to get the mobile version done since there weren't too many changes. I mostly had issues trying to get the right Bootstrap classes for the footer and highlight posts. Tomorrow I'm going to see if I need to make any changes for tablet screen size and make sure the desktop version needs any changes.

### Day 31: July 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Trying to set up React locally on computer. Updated CSS styles for mobile version of 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were mostly reading the React documentation. I wanted to try setting up React on my computer so I could see how the markdown previewer project worked locally. I wasn't having any luck getting the project working. I tried 4-5 tutorials to get everything set up but it wasn't working. I'll try the Create React App method again later to see if I can get it to work. During the last 30 minutes, I was working on the CSS for the 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio. The mobile styles were not appearing on Dev Tools preview. Once I exited out of the preview and played with the window sizes, the styles began appearing. At the end of the session, I checked to the previewer again to see what appeared and the styles I've been adding over the past 30 minutes were appearing in different sections throughout the page. However the styles are just fine when I adjust the browser window according to the pixel size. I've been adding most of the CSS styles for the mobile version of the site so I'll check tomorrow how everything looks in Dev Tools and see if I can fix it.

### Day 32: July 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start adding and updating styles for Markdown Previewer. Add more Bootstrap and CSS to 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** The first 30 minutes were adding styles to the Markdown Previewer. I took a couple of minutes to run through the tests and make sure everything was passing both on the CodePen pen and on my local computer. I changed around some of the variable names and added some documentation for specific parts of the code. Writing the comments was a little bit harder than I anticipated since the code wasn't appearing in the editor right away but I managed to add a couple of comments. The rest of the time was adjusting the CSS. I added a paragraph tag in the HTML for the directions and changed the columns for the container to rows. Then I just played around with the padding and the height. I just need to make a few smaller changes this project's CSS tomorrow then it should be ready to be submitted. Last 30 minutes were making more changes and updates to the 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio page. I figured out what was wrong with the site preview in dev tools. I forgot to add a meta tag for the view port. As soon as I added this in the head tag, the preview inside Dev Tools changed to reflect the changes I was adding. After fixing the viewport, I managed to get the mobile version of my site done. I was having issues with the buttons still trying to be right beside the images. However adding the btn-block class immediately put the buttons underneath the images in the highlight class. Tomorrow I need to finish adding styles to the tablet version of my site then see how everything looks in the desktop version.

### Day 33: July 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add remaining CSS styles to Markdown Previewer. Add header, main and footer tags to HTML. Finish adding CSS styles for 30 Days, 30 sites portfolio. Started preparing code files for 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation.

**Thoughts:** During the first 30 minutes, I finished updating the CSS styles for the Markdown Previewer project. These styles were less adding colors but getting the layout just right and playing with the padding. Any styling was for the newest additions such as header, footer and main tags. I did rearrange the markdowns in the JS Pen file. The CodePen file is done but I am going to test all the changes I made locally on my computer to see how everything looks. The last 30 minutes were just wrapping up final projects. The first few minutes were just adding the rest of the changes to the local version of the Markdown Previewer and running the tests to makes sure everything worked. I didn't need one line of code at the top for the React Component so I deleted it and just used import React from 'react'. Once the Markdown Previewer was done, I wrapped up styles for 30 Days, 30 Sites portfolio. I add mostly Bootstrap classes so it would work on medium and large size screens but I did add a little bit of padding to certain elements for the large screen size. Once those changes were done, I used the leftover time to start setting up for one of tomorrow's new projects. Tomorrow my goal is to focus on getting the event invitation completely set up and ready so I can get most of the HTML done.

### Day 34: July 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Setting up code files for Drum Machine project. Add HTML for drum machine, display and drum pads. Update HTML for 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Started to style the header.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were setting up the Drum Machine. I was setting up both the CodePen and a local one. After the debacle with the Markdown Previewer, setting up the local version was much easier and quicker. I managed to get two user stories to pass. These stories were mostly the elements for the drum-machine and display. I was working on the drum pad elements. I wasn't sure where to get the sounds so I was looking at Ben Brooke's tutorial just to see where he got his sounds. I found the link in his comments section and managed to add one sound in a sounds objects. Tomorrow I'll finish adding the sounds then I'll see getting audio element test to pass. The last 30 minutes were finishing organizing the 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. I started adding the HTML code for the project. I'm still using parts of the original version during the first round of 100 days of Code but most of the time was getting most of the code organized. I'll add more Bootstrap as I go throughout the project. I did add some additions such as the navbar at the top of the page. I did start some CSS styles for the project. Right now I'm working on getting the navbar ready before I move onto the rest of the header.

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/BritishPandaChick/pen/mZjxWN)

### Day 35: July 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Debug issues with Drum Machine. Finish adding sounds to sounds object. Add React Component for DrumPad element. Finish adding styles for navbar on 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Started adding styles for header.

**Thoughts:** During the first 30 minutes, all my tests for the drum machine I completed yesterday failed during one test run. At the time, I had individual drum pad elements within the display div tag which were passing as part of the initial tests. When I was adding a React Component, all the tests suddenly started to fail. So I spent a good chunk of the time figuring out why the tests weren't passing. I had to rewrite my original code several times but the original tests I passed yesterday turned green again. While watching the Ben Brooke's tutorial, I decided to try out his React Component method for the Drum Pad element. I set up most of the React Component so far. I just need to figure out to create the unique ids and get the drum pad elements to trigger. In the last 30 minutes, I was trying to figure out how to style the navbar. The links were still stacked up on each other so I was playing around with the Bootstrap classes. I was trying to use the documentation examples to troubleshoot the issues. Eventually I managed to get the link elements to be inline with each other by rearranging the Bootstrap classes. I did start adding styles for the header. Tomorrow I will concentrate on getting the header to work particularly getting the text in the middle of the background image if possible.

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/BritishPandaChick/pen/mZjxWN)

### Day 36: July 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Work on the DrumPad react component. Added Bootstrap classes and CSS styles for header, story and celebration sections on 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation page.

**Thoughts:** I did some more work on the react components for the drum machine. Before I started working, I ran more tests to see if all the tests I passed yesterday were still green. At first they weren't so I did some debugging. It turns out the errors were coming from the sounds variable and how they were called in the return method. As soon as I fixed the issue, the tests passed. Most of my time was spent trying to get the fourth test to pass. At the end of the 30 minute session, I was getting errors for the user story test five. The Q id isn't triggering when it is called which is causing both tests five and six to fail. So far I checked Q object to see if there were any errors. Tomorrow I'll do more debugging to see if I can fix the issue. I finished the header. Although I used some of my original code from the first round of 100 Days of Code, I played around with the styles for the background image. A lot of time was spent on the story section. The columns were stacking on top of each other. It turns out that I forgot the row class which helps get the elements inline with each other. Tomorrow I'll have to remember to use the row class when I work on the location. I added styles for three sections today. I just need to finish the celebration section then I can start tackling the location one tomorrow. I need to start thinking of how to add JavaScript to this project. I might create a modal for RSVP like the W3Schools example but I'm not sure yet.

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/BritishPandaChick/pen/mZjxWN)

### Day 37: July 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Pass user story 5 for drum machine. Started adding CSS styles and set a handleClick function to trigger audio sounds. Add more Bootstrap classes and CSS styles to 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Finished styles for location and info sections.

**Thoughts:** During the first 30 minutes, I spent a lot of time running the tests and making sure everything was passing. After some debugging, I focused on getting user story 5 to pass to get the audio to trigger when the drum pad element is clicked. I started adding some CSS styles for the drum pad elements. Initially they didn't appear on the screen because I misspelled the id name. Right now these styles are temporary. I plan on updating the styles once all the React is done. I spent a few minutes trying to fix the padding for the header greeting. I managed to get it centered in the middle of the background image, but I tried getting the text over towards the left so it wasn't covering Emma's face. However I ran into issues with the text editor so I just left it the way it is for now. I might play around with it again later. I added a new p tag in the location section. Out of the two sections I did today, location is where I spent most of my time. I was playing around with the columns, image and text to get all the elements the right size and spaced right. I decided I am going to make a modal for the invitation. Tomorrow I'm going to finish adding styles for the rest of the site before I tackle of the JavaScript. I'll do the responsive design once the JavaScript is all done.

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/BritishPandaChick/pen/mZjxWN)

### Day 38: July 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Pass user stories six and seven for drum machine. Add some temporary styles for the drum machine display. Add Bootstrap and CSS styles for response and footer sections in 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Started to add JavaScript for modal.

**Thoughts:** I passed the remaining user stories for the drum machine. Before I started working on the user story tests, I did run the tests to make sure the existing tests still passed. The hardest test to pass was the user story six. I put charCodeA instead of CharCodeAt in my handleKeyDown function. This messed up the componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount. Now that the JavaScipt is done, tomorrow I will be doing more updates on the CSS. Response and footer sections in the event invitation are now styled. Most of the time was spent getting started on the modal. I added the modal to my HTML and started adding the styles. I began adding some of the JavaScript to the modal. Right now the modal isn't showing when I click the button so I'm going to have to do some troubleshooting tomorrow. The console is saying the issue is for the close button. Tomorrow I'm going to debug JavaScript and see if I can get it to appear.

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/BritishPandaChick/pen/mZjxWN)

### Day 39: July 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Began add CSS and Bootstrap to drum machine. Change data variable to sounds. Update HTML, CSS and JavaScript for modal in 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Tried to get the modal to appear on the screen when button is clicked.

**Thoughts:** I started tweaking some of the JavaScript for the drum machine app. Biggest change was the sounds variable. I changed around some of the sounds and replaced the variable data to sounds. I made changes in the rest of the JavaScript file. I did run lots of tests to make sure everything was still passing. The rest of the time was starting to add styles for the app. The header styles are done and I'm halfway through the styles for the app. Tomorrow I'll finish the app styles and the footer. I was trying to get the drum pads to be in rows of three but I was putting the Bootstrap classes in the render function for the app instead of the drum pads. Tomorrow I'd like to try adding Bootstrap classes for the DrumPad render function to see what happens. I spent 30 minutes working on the modal. I didn't have much success. I did resolve the error with the close button. However the modal is still not appearing on the screen. When I opened Dev Tools, everything is working smoothly. I spent lots of the time looking at JavaScript documentation and reading articles to try different techniques but nothing changed. I think the issue might be in the event listeners and functions. Right now I am trying another tutorial to see if that works. If it doesn't, I'm going to redo the pseudo code and take away the CSS to see if I can get a basic version to appear.

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/BritishPandaChick/pen/mZjxWN)

### Day 40: July 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finish adding CSS styles to Drum Machine. Made final changes to Drum Machine code and ran final tests to make sure everything is consistent. Remove JavaScript code I've been using. Rewrote all modal code in HTML. Add links for jQuery and Bootstrap for JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I finished the drum machine in the first 30 minutes. I looked over the notes from yesterday's log and thought about trying to put the drum pads in columns stacked on top of each other. However I decided not to try it since I played around with the padding and height for the drum pads in a way I liked and I didn't want to change it. Maybe some day I'll revisit the project and try putting the drum pads rows of three. I ran the tests to make sure everything passed on CodePen then I ran the tests for my local file to ensure everything was consistent. When I saw the local preview, the id was still close to the border so I made a few adjustments to the padding, height and margins for the drum pad elements. I added the rest of the remaining styles for the footer and drum pads. I spent all my time trying to get the RSVP button to work. The original documentation I was trying to use wasn't working. So I did some googling to see what I could find. In the end, I decided to start over completely. I removed all the CSS and JavaScript code I had written. I began to redo the modal code itself. I read online to add links to the jQuery and Bootstrap JS file so I added those links to see if they would help. Right now I'm going back to using the W3Schools documentation. I'm going to also check out the Bootstrap documentation to see if I can at least get something to appear on the site.

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine](https://codepen.io/BritishPandaChick/pen/mZjxWN)

### Day 41: July 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed dependencies issues on Github.

**Thoughts:** I got more notifications of issues for some Github projects so I spent today's sessions troubleshooting these errors instead of getting started on a brand new project. I spent most of the time reading documentation and googling in order to fix the issues.

### Day 42: July 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Made an basic invitation for Khan Academy Event Invite project. Add more div tags to 30 Days, 30 Sites modal. Update CSS styles. Managed to get modal to toggle on with JavaScript. Began adding JS code to get the modal to close.

**Thoughts:** First few minutes were building another Khan Academy project. The event invite project is similar to the 30 Days, 30 Sites project I'm working so I made a basic version. I didn't play with a lot of the CSS properties in the lesson and instead focused on creating a basic version that resembles an invite you might see. Khan Academy limits most of the styling you can do on their platform so I wasn't able to do as much as I would like. Perhaps someday I'll make a better invite on CodePen or locally on my computer. After the Khan Academy invite, I started to do set up for the JavaScript calculator. I'm not going to use React for this project and am going to use jQuery as well as regular vanilla JavaScript if possible. I just need to finish the rest of the set up tomorrow. This includes adding code for the first three user stories. Perhaps I'll be able to start tackling the JavaScript tomorrow. I finished removing the Bootstrap modal code. I organized the modal code into different div tags for the modal header, body and footer. I started to add more CSS to the modal code. I originally had padding and height set for some of the modal elements but I removed them in order to play around with the .modal padding to see why it was moving the modal into the center of the page. I revisited the W3Schools modal tutorial and began having better luck with adding most of the CSS. I started adding the JavaScript. So far the variables are done. I am getting an error saying the onclick property isn't working so tomorrow I'm going to be doing some debugging to see onclick isn't working despite the button allowing the modal to open when it is clicked.

### Day 43: July 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continue setting up JavaScript Calculator HTML code. Fix issues for modal in 30 Days, 30 sites event invitation. Got modal to close. Move modal code closer to the RSVP button.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were just setting up the JavaScript Calculator. I'm starting to second guess what I'm doing based on reading the user stories but I decided to try seeing if I can make the tests without React. Most of the time was spent trying to get the HTML organized the way I wanted to and just trying to get the buttons to mimic what you would see on an calculator. I added a button for the AC but I'm leaning towards deleting it since it isn't required by the user stories. I think I'm going to DRY up the code I have tomorrow before I tackle the JavaScript and particularly see about getting the calculator centered in the middle of the page. Right now everything is on the left side. While the display can be center in the page, the buttons weren't cooperating. I don't want to start doing lots of styling but I might need to add some temporary CSS so I can see what I'm doing as I move into the JS. I'm almost in the home stretch with the modal. I figured out why I was getting errors in the console. It turns out that I added the punctuation for the IDs and classes was causing the onclick errors. As soon as I removed the punctuation in the variables, everything started to pass and it began start acting as a modal. The only issue I have now when the modal closes, the backdrop still remains dark. I will try playing around with some of the JS code to see if I can get the backdrop to get back to normal. I started playing with the JS a little bit, but I wasn't having much luck. I think I might have to try setting the data attributes but I'm not 100% sure if that is the right solution.

### Day 44: July 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add temporary CSS styles to JavaScript Calculator. Reorganized HTML code. Fixed modal backdrop. Tried making responsive styles for 30 Days, 30 sites event invitation. Started set up for next project.

**Thoughts:** I'm having issues getting the calculator to look just the way I want in HTML. I removed some of the Bootstrap classes and started playing around with the tags to see if I could get them in the center of the page. I added some CSS styles to help me see where everything is on the page. This is mostly old code I used before but it is temporary. Once all the JavaScript is added, I'll replace all the old styles with brand new code. Tomorrow I'm going to play around with the CSS to see if I can get it to look like a calculator on CodePen instead of a bunch of buttons grouped together in the middle of the page. I fixed the modal backdrop. After reading some of the documentation and some articles, I decided to just remove the data attributes on the modal button. Once I removed the data attributes I added some background color to the modal. This make a huge difference and would be removed when the modal closed. I tried working on the responsive styles for the site but Dev Tools was acting up. When I was refreshing my site preview, Dev Tools immediately paused the site in the debugger. I tried googling for a solution but I wasn't having much luck. I finally got frustrated and decided to switch gears by starting set up on the next project. Tomorrow I'm going to try again to see if I can get the responsive styles to work in the previewer but if I can't I'll just move onto the next project.

### Day 45: July 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished adding HTML and CSS code for JavaScript Calculator. Started adding JS variables. Remove Bootstrap classes for navbar in 30 Days, 30 Sites invitation. Start adding mobile CSS styles.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were playing with the Bootstrap for the JavaScript Calculator. I added back the divs with the row class for the buttons. I tried playing with the margin for the a tags but it was creating too big of a space between the buttons. I decided to wrap all the buttons in a container with the buttons class. I used the buttons class to add styles and play with the margins. This worked and got the buttons in the center of the calculator. I don't think the padding I set for the display is going to work as I start doing calculations with the JS later, but I'll wait until all the JS code is done to fix. it. I did start on some of the JS. Right now I'm adding the variables. Tomorrow I'd like to get user story 8 to pass in the tests. I did some googling before starting this coding session to see what was going on with Dev Tools. I did manage to get it fixed, but I was just clicking around with elements in the source window. Whatever I did do I fixed everything. During the session, the navbar wasn't fitting on the entire page when it was on a mobile screen. I ended up removing the navbar Bootstrap classes which fixed the problem. I'll just need to use CSS to replicate what I originally had. I started adding the mobile styles to the site. I was originally was going put all the styles in the same style sheet, but I decided to add a CSS folder and create separate files for different stylesheets for each. Right now I'm working on the mobile styles. Biggest issue I have is the input is cutting off near the left side of the screen when the modal is open. Tomorrow I'll see if I can change the CSS so that doesn't happen on the mobile version of the modal.

### Day 46: July 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Pass the user story test seven for JavaScript Calculator. Started working on getting user story 8 to pass. Tried to fix input for mobile modal. Add styles for responsive version of 30 Days, 30 Sites invitation.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were working on getting the user story seven to pass. I managed to get the test to pass and get the preliminary code up for the buttons working. Right now nothing is able to display when the buttons are clicked. Tomorrow I'm going to do some debugging for the functions I added to see if I can get something to appear on the span tag. Finished the mobile and responsive CSS styles. The input on the mobile still looks like it is being cut off near the left side. I tried fixing the CSS but wasn't having much luck so I'll just leave it the way it is. I did start adding CSS styles for the responsive tablet version of the site. I spent a lot of time deciding on specific Bootstrap classes for the location and story sections. I decided to use col-md-12 instead of col-md-6 since the columns looked as if the images were being squashed together. I added some padding for the p tag in the location section so there was a little bit of space between the image and text. Tomorrow I'm going to tackle the navbar on the desktop version. Without the Bootstrap classes, I'm going to need to figure out how to recreate the same thing using CSS.

### Day 47: July 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tried to debug JavaScript Calculator. Removed JS code and started from scratch. Played around with screen sizes for media attribute in HTML file for 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Tried getting CSS for main stylesheet to appear on website.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were trying to fix my JavaScript Calculator. I tried getting the calculator to show the inputs but nothing was appearing on the screen. I didn't spent much time coding but reading documentation and googling. After several attempts, I decided to remove my original JS code and start over. Right now the tests say all 9 tests are passing but in reality only 6 tests pass. Tomorrow I'm going to see if I can get user story seven to pass again. I didn't have much luck with getting the navigation to appear. I thought the problem was the screen sizes so I tried playing around with the media attribute in the head tag for all the stylesheets to see if I could fix it this way. It didn't work. In the end, I moved the h1 navbar from the nav and added a class to the row for styling. So far it is working. As I was checking the mobile section, the background image is now moving towards the middle of the page. I'll see if I can get it to move a little bit to the left side of the page.

### Day 48: July 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added variables for JavaScript Calculator. Started working on getting clear button to work. Fixed mobile and responsive stylesheets for 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Tried fixing main desktop style sheet.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were getting the variables written down in the JS file. I looked mostly at the user stories to get a sense of what variables might be needed. So far I've got at least five variables. I might need more but for now I'm picking ones that I will need to pass user story seven. Oddly the tests are still passing for user story 7 and 10. I think that is due to the display already being set to 0 in the HTML. I was working on getting the clear button to work for user story seven but I'm debating on focusing on a different user story to pass first to see if the calculator button works. I spent all my time working on the CSS for the invitation. It took some time copying and pasting code but I managed to fix the issues with the mobile website. I managed to get the responsive version done since there weren't too many changes. The one that is proving to be the biggest challenge is the main desktop version. Somehow the styles aren't appearing for the navigation bar. I played with the screen sizes and even removed the links for the main style sheet but the styles I want still aren't appearing. I double checked all my styles for the other two stylesheets and they are working just fine. So tomorrow I'm going to figure out what is wrong with the main stylesheet and get something to appear. I have removed the code I was using and am slowly adding it back to see what my site looks like without any of the styles.

### Day 49: July 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed main styles for 30 Days, 30 Sites event invitation. Double check all HTML, CSS and JS code. Tried more work getting user story seven to pass for JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts:** I finally finished the event invitation. It turns out that I created another style file not in the assets folder. This code was mixing with the styles in the style.css folder in the assets folder. So I deleted the style file outside of the assets folder and updated the CSS in the style file in the assets folder. This fixed everything and the styles appeared. I did the last checks of all the code files before pushing to the git repo. I ran into problems here and got an error saying "error: cannot stat 'assets/css': Permission denied" so I had to google a bit to figure out what was wrong. I decided the best thing to do was close out of all my files and text editor then restart everything. As soon as I did this, everything worked just fine. Tomorrow it is time to get back to the tourist attraction website! Last 30 minutes were more work on the JavaScript Calculator. I didn't do as much coding instead was reading jQuery documentation and using the Jon Duckett JavaScript & jQuery book to help me. I watched Dylan Israel's Calculator video and felt maybe that was the right direction to go. Tomorrow I'm going to use what I've learned from Dylan's video to help with the JavaScript.

### Day 50: July 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished set up for 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction website. Began adding HTML code to index file. Used Dylan Israel's JS Calculator tutorial to get items displaying on the calculator.

**Thoughts:** I got a good head start on some of the HTML code. It isn't completely done. I finished all the set up. I'm debating on if I should add some JavaScript to this site or not. The plan for this project is working with CSS Flexbox mostly. I still have some Bootstrap because I do want some practice but mostly I'd like to use Flexbox the right way this time. Right now I've added the header and footer for the website. I started adding sections to the website. I'm not quite sure what to add so I did look as some other tourist attraction websites on the website to get an idea of what sections I can add to my site. Hopefully tomorrow I can finish the HTML and get a good start on the CSS. During the last 30 minutes, I worked on the JavaScript Calculator. I revisited and coded along with Dylan's calculator to see how that works. It kind of worked. I was able to get items to display on the calculator. It was all text though but I was proud to get at least something to appear on the display. The totals were not appearing either when I pressed the equal sign. However I can use Dylan's code as a base to see what I can do to further add and change so it can work as a true calculator.

### Day 51: July 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Tried debugging JavaScript Calculator. Worked on trying to get user story seven to pass. Finish adding HTML sections to 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction website. Began adding CSS styles.

**Thoughts:** I spent the first 30 minutes trying to get the JavaScript Calculator tests to pass. I wasn't having much luck. So I restarted my code over again and set up the pseudo code for user story seven. I decided to remove 0 from the HTML since it was throwing off my tests. So far I've set up variables for the input and outputs. I was setting up an onclick function for the clear button to see if that might work. Tomorrow I'm going to finish the onclick function and see how to clear the values with JavaScript. I'll be using lots of the documentation tomorrow to see what I can find on doing this and getting 0 to show up in the display id without putting one in the HTML. I managed to get all the HTML added. I get a feeling I'll be adding more HTML as I go so I'll probably add more as I add more CSS. I started adding CSS to the website. So far I've managed to get some of the navbar done. I'm using some of the colors I used in the original version I made from round one. Right now my plan is to get most of the CSS on the site before I start playing around with Flexbox since that will impact lots of responsive styles. I added a form element in the HTML this time. It won't actually work but I want to practice putting a form element on a website. I'm also using this project to use the iframe tag more by adding sections for Google Maps or video.

### Day 52: July 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Passed user story seven for JavaScript Calculator. Started working on user story eight. Add CSS to header, navbar and discover sections for 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction website. Start adding CSS styles for map.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes of the JavaScript Calculator didn't have a whole lot of coding. I was looking through Jon Duckett's JavaScript & jQuery book to get some help on how to pass user story seven. I eventually set up an on click event handler which set the inputs and outputs to zero. I used the html method to set everything to 0. This passed the test. Right now I'm working on user story 8. I didn't have much luck today since it would cause the tests for user story seven to pass. Tomorrow I'll see if I can get the numbers I input to appear on the calculator without messing up user story seven test. Mostly worked on the CSS styles for 30 Days, 30 Sites for tourist attraction website. I did go back into the HTML a little bit to change two classes into ids as well as adding some Bootstrap classes. I managed to get most of the styles done for header, navbar and discover sections. I spent a lot of time trying to get the header background image and text just right. It took more padding than I expected to get the h2 headline in the center of the page. Biggest thing I've learned today is to keep headlines out of the row div tag. The row class causes the headlines and any elements that follow it to be mixed up all over the page. Putting the headlines outside of the row class prevents this from happening and allows Bootstrap to get the columns just right.

### Day 53: July 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added styles for map, video and festivals sections. Tried adding margin and padding between discover elements. Worked on trying to get user story 8 to pass.

**Thoughts:** Mostly used CSS for today's activities. At the beginning of the session I went back into the discover section and tried adding some padding between the three p tags so there was a little more space between them. It didn't work so I just left them the way they are for now. I spent most of the time working on the map, video and festivals section. The iframe tags were a little bit harder to style than I anticipated. I found myself spending lots of time moving back and forth between the width and height to get everything looking just right. Padding proved to be a big issue for the festivals section. I spent a lot of time adjusting the padding so the text wasn't near the top of the background image. The last 30 minutes were more attempts on trying to get the user story 8 test to pass. I didn't do too much testing except to make sure everything I worked on yesterday was still passing. Today I was working on getting the input numbers to display. I didn't do too much coding since I was using the Jon Duckett book to see what I could use. Based on the user story, there needs to be if-else statements to see if number begins with zeros and to look out for decimals. With the way my code is written, I need to use the push method to add the inputs to the array. I just am not sure how to get the numbers to display. I started a for loop but I'm thinking about going back to the switch statement where I'll have each case joining the inputs together. Then I'll use the html method to trying get them to show on the display.

### Day 54: July 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finish adding styles to main style file. Create new stylesheets for responsive styles. Started adding styles for mobile version of site. Continued working on the JavaScript Calculator user story eight test.

**Thoughts:** I got the main stylesheet finished with all the styles. Although these styles are done, I commented them out in the index file to play around with the Flexbox. I'm not sure if Flexbox will be 100% effective with Bootstrap so I'm debating on deleting Bootstrap off this project and just using Flexbox only. I started to play around with Flexbox on the mobile of the site. It is taking me awhile since I'm using the CSS Tricks blog to review the properties. I did decide this website won't have any JavaScript so I can give all my attention on getting Flexbox working on the site. Last 30 minutes were working on the JS calculator. I decided the for loop wasn't the best way to go so I was trying to make the switch statement work. I think the number ids need to be selected when they are clicked then added into the inputs array. Then the inputs array is updated to display everything on the calculator. I spent time trying to get the switch statement to work but I gave up when it wasn't working. I think tomorrow I'm going to try the switch statement again and set up some pseudo code. Then I'll see if I can get a least zero working on the screen.

### Day 55: July 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a flowchart to help figure out the user story tests. Started adding if-else statements for numbers so they might display on the page. Add more CSS to mobile stylesheet for 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction website. Add Bootstrap classes for small screens in HTML file.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes didn't really involve any coding but preparing for coding. I spent most of the time using paper and pencil to create a flowchart to help me figure out some of the user stories. After the flow chart was finished, I used the last few minutes of that session to start trying to get the buttons for the numbers to work. So far I'm trying to use if-else statements if the a tag is clicked. Right now I'm trying to do it individually with a couple of numbers to see it will work then trying with the other numbers. I did some googling before starting this session and it turns out that Flexbox is already included in Bootstrap 4 so I don't need to add more Flexbox classes to this site. Therefore I'm going to just use this project as a way to get more practice with Bootstrap. The next project will be the Flexbox project without any Bootstrap. Mostly worked with the CSS today. Mobile CSS is almost done. I just need to finish adding CSS to two sections and it will be done. I had some issues checking the preview in Dev Tools. The previewer looked as if it was cutting off parts of my site. Eventually I just exited out of the previewer view and played with the window sizes with Dev Tools on to double check my styles. Tomorrow before I start the responsive styles I'm going to use the previewer one last time to see how everything looks.

### Day 56: July 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finish adding CSS styles to 30 Days, 30 Sites tourist attraction website. Spent more time working on getting user story 8 to pass on JS Calculator.

**Thoughts:** I finished the tourist attraction website. I added the remaining CSS styles for mobile, responsive and main stylesheets. I checked the previewer in Dev Tools to see how everything looked on the screen. I had no problems with the previewer today. Only HTML I added were the Bootstrap classes for medium and large screens. I didn't have to make too many tweaks to the CSS but I did use the CSS to play around with the width and height of the iframe, video and input tags. Last 30 minutes were spent working on the JS calculator. Still not having much success getting the calculator to work. I decided to scrap what I was originally working and use a function with a for loop that would look at the inputs. So first if statement checks to see if the input begins with zero. If that is false, then it would push the input to inputs array. It didn't work but I think I need the jQuery selector I was using to select the buttons then have the function run the for loop.

### Day 57: July 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started to set up 30 Days, 30 Sites product website. Created new stylesheets. Began adding HTML code for header, footer, navigation and some of the website sections. Tried using regular vanilla JavaScript to get JavaScript Calculator to work. Add data-action attribute on div tags calculator buttons.

**Thoughts:** Today was all about setting up for the project and getting everything ready. This mean setting up the Github repo, organizing CSS folders, getting all the links needed to make this project and more. I'm not using Bootstrap on this project and am going to instead use Flexbox. Right now the focus is on getting the HTML on the page. The challenge with this website is trying to figure out what Mr. Gold would want on his website. I started looking at a couple of examples to get an idea of what to possibly put. So far I'm planning on using the images from the round one version of the site but it is hard knowing what to put on the website since he's a mysterious character on the show so I'm going to look at a few real life examples to see how to model this website for Mr. Gold. Last 30 minutes were doing more work on the JavaScript Calculator. I spent most of the time googling where I found a Free Code Camp article about using the data-action attribute in HTML only using JavaScript. So I commented out the jQuery code I've been working with and started using the Free Code Camp article as a guide to setting up the HTML with the data-action attribute. So far it isn't working but tomorrow I'm going to keep trying with this article's suggestion and see if that works. I'll see outside of the challenge if I can get some advice on my code in the meantime to see if I was heading in the right direction with my code.

### Day 58: July 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add new sections to 30 Days, 30 Sites product site HTML code. Start adding CSS styles for mobile stylesheet. Debug working code for JavaScript Calculator. Created if-else statements to check for decimals, operators and numbers.

**Thoughts:** I added most of the HTML to the product site. I found a pawnshop website that I liked online and used it as a influence for Mr. Gold's website. I add a couple more links to the navigation. The rest of the time was adding the rest of the sections to the website. I deleted a section planned for the location and moved it up near the top near the logo area. I was able to added a note from the Gold family and created the preview section which included images from the round one website. I did get a head start on the mobile CSS by adding some of the basic styles. Tomorrow I'm still planning on doing the styles but I might add some more HTML sections to the site as well as extra classes to help work with flexbox. Last 30 minutes were working on the JavaScript Calculator. I ran into some errors yesterday at the end of yesterday's session so I did some debugging to the code. I spent a little more time in the HTML & CSS than usual today. I changed the div tags to buttons and moved the display inside the calculator id. This messed up the CSS a little bit so I made some tweaks to get a working version ready to go. I moved around all the operators, clear button and decimal. I gave the operators and clear button new classes in the HTML to use with the JavaScript. The biggest accomplishment was getting the buttons working with JavaScript. They only said they were working in the console, but it was better than an error message. Right now I'm starting to remove the console.logs I've made in the if-else statements and started adding code to check for the data attributes and replacing the 0 in the display with the input using the textContent property.

### Day 59: July 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add more CSS mobile stylesheet of 30 Days, 30 Sites product site. Tried adding styles to make a hamburger menu website using only CSS. Working on getting basic calculator functions to work for JS Calculator.

**Thoughts:** I decided not to add more sections to the product site. I took a look at the site before I started today's session and decided to leave what I original planning off the website. I didn't make as much progress since I decided to make a hamburger menu for the mobile site. Most of the time was googling to see what properties I needed to use. Some websites suggested using JavaScript as well as CSS so I set up a JS file just in case I need it. If I don't, I'll delete it later. So far I'm using the CSS Tricks post to help me. Right now the nav bar is hidden. So I'll see how to toggle everything tomorrow. Last 30 minutes were spent working on the JS Calculator. I'm using the Free Code Camp article to help me try getting the basic JS functions to work. Right now the user story tests are passing 9/16. One I think is passing since there is a 0 typed in the display. The buttons are still able to console.log what kind of buttons they are but I'm working on trying to get the buttons to display numbers on the screen. Tomorrow I'll do some more debugging before I progress further with my code to see if I can fix it.

### Day 60: July 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add new HTML & CSS for 30 Days, 30 Sites product site for hamburger menu. Add a function for JavaScript button to see if I can toggle hamburger menu. Debugged working code for JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were just working on getting the hamburger menu to work. I rearranged the hamburger icon in the HTML and was trying to get the icon next to the h1 tag. I gave up after several attempts and decided to focus on getting the hamburger menu to work. After reading through the CSS Tricks blog post, I decided I needed to use JavaScript to get it to work so I did more googling. I found a W3Schools article for creating a mobile navigation bar so I decided to try it and see if I could get it to work. Right now I've got a function ready in the JS file. The console says everything works but when I click the icon nothing opens. So I'm going to do some debugging and see how to fix it tomorrow. Last 30 minutes of the session were debugging all the code I've written so far for the JavaScript Calculator. The console is showing no errors but the calculator still isn't displaying any of the numbers. Today only 7 out of 16 user story tests are passing. Since I've got a lot of code written so far, tomorrow I'm going organize the code back into separate functions and call them inside keys.addEventListener instead of having tons of if-else statements. I'll use this as an opportunity to do more debugging and test each function to see what happens.

### Day 61: July 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started creating functions for if-else statements in JS Calculator code. Debugging code as I organize code into functions. Finished styles for hamburger menu on mobile version of 30 Days, 30 Sites product website. Started adding styles for logo section.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were working on the JS Calculator. My code is getting really messy so I started to refactor the code I had to make it nicer, neater and organized. I'm debugging the code as I go. I originally had 11/16 tests passing but as of right now only 9/16 are passing due to all the debugging and code changes happening. Right now I'm setting up an function that will only run if the data action attribute is set to decimal. The hamburger menu is officially done! I spent most of the time debugging and fixing the CSS in order to get everything to work. It isn't 100% perfect. There are ways to improve the styles and make it look and feel like an actual hamburger menu on any mobile website. However I decided to not mess around further with the styles and use that time to play around with Flexbox instead. The remaining time was used to start adding styles for the logo section. I mostly was playing around with the height of the section so there wasn't too many changes to the CSS today. Tomorrow I'll have more time to play around with the height as well as changing the fonts, colors and padding.

### Day 62: August 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished adding styles to the mobile stylesheet for 30 Days, 30 Sites product website. Started adding styles for the responsive stylesheet. Debugged and organized code for JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts:** I finished most of the mobile styles for the product site. Most of these sections were just updating the font sizes, font families and colors. I'll probably add more CSS styles in the future as I keep playing around with the Flexbox properties. I did start adding styles for the responsive stylesheet. Once I set display to flex, my website moved all the elements into rows. My plan right now is to tackle each section one at a time so I can play around with the different Flexbox properties and see what happens on my site. Right now my header section looks similar to the one on my mobile site so I'll see if Flexbox can help me fix this issue tomorrow. Last 30 minutes were doing more debugging on my JS calculator. The numbers are still not displaying on my website but I'm not worrying about that right now. Instead I'm trying to read through my code and get everything organized. I am putting a lot of the if-else statements into functions then calling the functions when a key is clicked. 9 out of 16 user stories are still passing according to the tests. While the code doesn't work, organizing it is making it less messy and easier to read so I can get a sense of where the problems might be in my code. I am getting a feeling it is might be due to the variables I'm using. I'll do more debugging and troubleshooting tomorrow to see if the variables are causing a problem.

### Day 63: August 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did more debugging for JS Calculator. Played around with the Flexbox properties for 30 Days, 30 Sites responsive product site. Add more CSS styles to website sections.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were debugging my JS calculator so I didn't get too much done. I double checked all my variables today but that doesn't seem to be the issue with why specific tests aren't passing. I think the issues might be in the functions I just created. So I started looking over all my code to make sure I'm using the right names in my HTML that I'm using in my JS file. I added a couple of new classes to some of the elements to see if that would be easier to work with. I took some time to read and play around with some of the Flexbox properties on my website. I don't think I'm probably using Flexbox correctly but many of the properties I tried didn't do anything in the previewer. So I just kept the flex-direction property set to column and everything was working. I had issues trying to hide the hamburger icon on the responsive website but thanks to Google I learned about the visibility property. This made it so much easier to hide the icon instead of using the display property. The rest of the time was spent adding CSS to the responsive site. The preview section is giving me the most trouble right now. Tomorrow I'll see if I can use Flexbox to get everything aligned just right in the preview section.

### Day 64: August 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finish styles for responsive version of 30 Days, 30 Sites product website. Start adding styles to the desktop stylesheet. Did more debugging on JavaScript Calculator. Started to refactor code.

**Thoughts:** The responsive stylesheet is finished. The biggest issue I had was getting the preview section to not overlap each other on the page. None of the Flexbox properties were working very well so I removed styles I set for half-width class. This allowed preview elements to line up in rows instead of them being all over the page. I started adding styles for the desktop version of the site. Initially I was planning on having my navigation on the right side of the page, but the styles didn't look right when all the links were aligned on the right. So I decided to leave the navigation underneath the headline. Header, logo and note are done on the desktop stylesheet so I'll be back to getting the preview section to work on desktop stylesheet tomorrow. Last 30 minutes were spent working on the JavaScript Calculator. Most of the time was spent working on refactoring my code. I didn't get much testing done but at the end of the 30 minutes 9 out of 16 tests are still passing. In the article I'm using for this latest attempt of the calculator, they don't recommend using multiple functions and calling them in the addEventListener like I was doing. They instead recommend using two different functions. So I spent the last few minutes setting up these two functions. I'll refactor the code I have now so it will work within these two functions.

### Day 65: August 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Debugged and refactored code for JavaScript Calculator. Finish adding CSS to 30 Days, 30 Sites product website. Double check all product website code. Start setting up 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu site.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were doing more work on the JS Calculator. I spent the entire time doing more debugging and refactoring code. Still have 9 out of 16 tests passing so I was reading more JS documentation and the Free Code Camp article I'm using. If I'm not seeing any progress tomorrow, I'm going to just start over the JS code from scratch. I finished working on the product website. This was just adding the last bit of CSS to the desktop CSS file. Most of the time was spent fixing the preview section. Initially nothing would change when I added the flexbox properties. When I added a border, it looked as if the code was making a variety of different boxes throughout the section. It took sometime trying different Flexbox properties in div classes but everything lined up in a row once I set the flex-direction and display for the full-width class. Once this worked, I went back to the preview section and played around with the padding so there would be a little bit of spacing around and between the elements. Once all the CSS was done, I looked at the entire site in Dev Tools to see what final changes might need to be made. Now that the product website is done, I started to set up work for the next project. So far I've just organizing the code files so I can find them. Tomorrow I'll finish set up and begin working on the code.

### Day 66: August 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Did set up for 30 Days, 30 Sites Restaurant Menu website. Started to add HTML code for the website. Did some more debugging and refactoring on JS Calculator. Removed all code and started over.

**Thoughts:** Today's session was mostly getting the rest of the website set up and ready to go. This means adding all the links and setting up the files. Once the set up is finished, I started adding some of the HTML. I managed to get the header and footer sections done. I'm not quite sure what sections to put on my website. Right now I've only got a couple of sections on the website but I wasn't sure what to put. Tomorrow I'll work more on the sections. I think I'll just keep this website simple in order to focus on creating a form as well as working with JavaScript and Bootstrap. Last 30 minutes were spent working on the JS calculator. I still wasn't having much luck passing any of the remaining tests so I decided to just completely start over with all my code. I saved all the code I've been using to a branch of the Github repository. It sucks starting over yet again but I think it is better starting over than continuing a path that isn't getting me anywhere. Right now I'm rebuilding the calculator HTML code. So far I've got 4 tests passing. Most of the calculator buttons have been added. I have been working through the user story tests one at a time to make sure everything is passing before I move onto the next step.

### Day 67: August 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Added more HTML sections to 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu website. Added sections for info, hours, about, events and new. Started working on menu section. Finished setting up calculator.

**Thoughts:** I am making more progress on the HTML. Before I started working on the project, I took a look at different bistro and cafe websites. I also looked at different French restaurant websites to get an idea how to structure the website. I took this information and started creating these sections on my website. I didn't add too many Bootstrap classes yet but once all the HTML is added I'm going to go through and see where I can add Bootstrap classes before I begin working with the CSS. The only section I am still struggling with because I'm not 100% sure how I want to present the menu on the browser. I think I'll try replicating the W3Schools menu setup with only Bootstrap and JavaScript. The last thing I need to do is finish the menu section. I've got two more sections to go. However I'm not going to dive straight into the CSS yet. I'd like to see where I can add more Bootstrap classes and organize my HTML a bit before I start playing with the styles. The last 30 minutes were spent working on the JS calculator code. My calculator is definitely not the prettiest calculator in the world. The CSS is kept to a minimum in order to get a working version of a calculator to appear on CodePen. I finished setting up the HTML code for the calculator. The first six user story tests all pass at the moment so I can start working on the logic. I've been looking at some of the sample projects on CodePen and ones other devs have shared with me from the CodeNewbie chats. It seems as if many of them use Babel as part as the JS preprocessor so I am going to use this attempt to see if it will work. With this in mind, I'm going to copy my original JS code back into CodePen to see if that will make any difference now that I'm using Babel. If it doesn't, then I can delete and focus on getting user story 7 to pass.

### Day 68: August 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finish adding HTML to menu section of 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu website. Started adding CSS styles. Slowly added back code from Free Code Camp article to CodePen file for JS Calculator.

**Thoughts:** I finished adding all the HTML to the site. I decided to add h3 headlines to the menu section. I changed the headlines for all the menu items to h4 tags. Once the menu section was done, I added more Bootstrap classes. Most of these classes were container tags. I set up the column widths for the menu section just to see how they would look the site. I might change these classes as I work with the CSS for different screen sizes. The rest of the session was starting to add CSS to my website. I had more issues with the Dev Tools previewer. My styles weren't appearing on the previewer. Once I exited out of the previewer and played around with the screen sizes the styles began appearing. Tomorrow I'll play around with Dev Tools to see if I can get it to work. I did get a head start on the header by adding the background image and setting the width. Tomorrow I'll finish adding styles to the header and working on the navigation. The last 30 minutes were adding code slowly back to the JavaScript Calculator. The numbers are displaying when clicked which is a good thing. However the operators aren't appearing on the site and it doesn't calculate quite yet. Only 6-7 user stories are passing in the testing. When I have been testing the site, I noticed that a bunch of numbers randomly appear on the display when I run the tests. I will try debugging these issues. I get a feeling the issue might be in the HTML more than the JS but I'll double check both tomorrow.

### Day 69: August 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Debugging and refactoring JS calculator code. Added and removed Bootstrap classes from 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu website. Add new CSS styles for header, info, about and hours sections.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were spent working on the calculator. I had 8 user story tests passing but at the end of the session they were back to 7 when I started breaking my code and refactoring everything. Right now I'm creating a function that creates the result string. So far I've added four if statements that check if it is a key number and if there is a decimal. As I add the if statements to the new function I'm double checking all my code as I go to see if everything is working. I stopped at adding the if statement for the operators. Tomorrow I'll debug and add this to createResultString function. Before I started the session I figured out what was wrong with my mobile styles. It turns out I forgot the meta tag in the head tag for the viewport. Once I added the tag everything started working the way it should. The previewer is still acting a little off since styles take time to appear but it is an improvement from yesterday. I'm not completely happy with the header. The background image isn't positioned so the sign is in the middle of the page but I found myself spending too much time nitpicking on something small so I'll leave it the way it is for now and come back to it later. The rest of the session was spent working in CSS and adding CSS styles to the sections on the website. I started the menu section today. I will use the Bootstrap classes to play around with the menu items and prices to see if I can put some spacing between the two.

### Day 70: August 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add and remove Bootstrap classes from 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu website. Add CSS to h2 headline for menu section. Continue debugging and refactoring JS Calculator.

**Thoughts:** Today I spent most of my time in the HTML files getting the menu code set up. I'm using the W3Schools template as guidance to how to set up and organize my code for this section. I removed some of the Bootstrap classes like the row div tags and add new Bootstrap classes. This included more container classes for each sub-menu. I moved some of the headlines to the top of the menu. I added p tags under each menu item for the description. I don't think I'm completely done with the HTML but I'll add more Bootstrap and HTML classes as I start working with the JavaScript. I did add some CSS for the h2 headline. Tomorrow I'll finish adding some of the basic styles for the rest of the menu section then I am going to start tackling the JavaScript. The last 30 minutes were spent doing more refactoring and debugging the JavaScript Calculator code. The tests were acting strange for the calculator. Initially only one of 16 tests were passing. The tests kept saying a hook was missing. After saving and refreshing CodePen a couple of times, the tests finally went back to 7 out of 16. I didn't add too much new code. I am still using the Free Code Camp article to double check my code. The createResultString function is finished. I created a getKeyType function that returns the type of key was pressed. I started a new function called updateCalculatorState that will update the calculator. Right now I'm working on getting the calculator to update when users press an operator button.

### Day 71: August 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add JS code to 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu website. Played around with CSS for menu section. Created a main.css file. Debugging and refactoring JS Calculator code.

**Thoughts:** I created a JavaScript function for the menu site. I added the function to the onclick attribute in the index file. The function doesn't work yet because the classes I use in the function don't exist yet. I noticed in the W3Schools example they use separate classes with different styles. I tried out some of these styles on the mobile stylesheet as well as looked at the code in Dev Tools to see how it works. So I created a brand new stylesheet where these menu styles will live so they can be used on all different screen sizes. Tomorrow I will use the W3Schools template as a guide to naming new classes that will be used in main.css and adding the styles so it will look similar to the W3Schools menu section template. Last 30 minutes were spent working on the JS calculator. The results from the tests remained the same so I've been going back to Google and reading the documentation to see what I can find. I set up a separate local file on my computer to play with the JS code from another video tutorial I found on YouTube as well as using the CodePen pen to play around with the JS code I've already used. Right now I'm going to use the newest YouTube tutorial to see how it works locally then use what I've learned in this tutorial to help me with the pen project. In the local file, I started adding HTML code the tutorial recommends. This tutorial uses a form instead of buttons like I've been using in the past version. I haven't made a lot of forms with my code so this tutorial is a good practice on how I can use forms in future projects. Tomorrow I'd like to finish the HTML for the project so I can start working locally on the JS.

### Day 72: August 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add HTML and CSS code to local code files for JS Calculator. Add input tags for buttons. Start adding CSS selectors to main stylesheet. Used Dev Tools to look at the styles on W3Schools template to see what classes to add to index file and what styles to use on the main stylesheet.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were spent playing around with the local code files using the YouTube tutorial I found yesterday. This tutorial uses input tags for all the calculator buttons. There were more testing issues. Although all the ids are on the calculator buttons, the tests are coming back saying only one test is passing. The failures say things like "before each" hook and "after all" hook. I initially created classes for keys and having the ids be the ones Free Code Camp wants. This didn't make any difference with the testing. These failures are due to the backspace function not being defined since I don't have a backspace function ready so I'm going to just ignore the testing until I start working on the JavaScript. The rest of the session was spent working on the CSS for the calculator. I'm keeping the styles relatively simple in order to put most of the focus on JavaScript but I had fun playing with the box shadow property. I started to add CSS selectors and properties to the main stylesheet. I spent a lot of time looking at the W3Schools template in dev tools and seeing how they did their styles. Right now my menu section is going to look very similar to what is on the W3Schools template. I am planning on changing the styles later to reflect the design for my site. For now I just want to get the site set up the right way and get the classes right so I can get the JavaScript working correctly. So far I've gotten a good head start on the styles. I'm not sure how they did their row class but I'll see if I can figure it out with Dev Tools later. I am removing some of the bootstrap classes for the new CSS classes. Tomorrow I'll be focusing on updating the menu section HTML code with more classes and trying to add more styles to the main stylesheet.

### Day 73: August 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Began adding JS code for local JS calculator. Finished adding CSS. Continued to add more CSS styles to main stylesheet for 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu website. Update and change CSS classes in HTML.

**Thoughts:** Most work on the JS calculator was on the HTML & CSS. I managed to get the CSS finished. I got a head start on the JS. In the YouTube tutorial the buttons would actually display the results when they were pressed. Mine doesn't. So I started double checking the HTML to see if I made a mistake with the HTML classes and ids. I continued to add more CSS to the main stylesheet. Today I managed to start adding styles to the menu items. I got the menu items for the entree items done and got a head start on adding the CSS to the main course items. So far the a tags are working just like the W3Schools template with a few minor changes. Once I'm done adding all the CSS to the main stylesheet I will try updating the stylesheets to see if I can use less classes for my code as well as update the colors to match the ones I'm using on the entire site. But for now I'd like to get the working version ready to go as I possibly can.

### Day 74: August 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**:Finish adding CSS for menu section of 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu. Began combining class styles on stylesheets and updating classes on index file. Started to update CSS styles. Add four new functions to local JS Calculator website. Debug index file for syntax errors.

**Thoughts:** I spent most of the time working on the CSS. I did play around with some of the JavaScript in the script file. I just updated some of the class names in the script file. Once the menu styles are completely done, I'll start tackling the JavaScript code. Once the CSS styles were done for the menu section, I started going through the main stylesheet to see which classes could be combined together in order to cut down on the some of the classes assigned to different HTML elements. So far I've move some of the styles to classes I already created on the mobile stylesheet. As I add styles to the mobile stylesheet, I am updating the styles to match the styles I'm already using on the website. I am also adding Bootstrap classes to help with the section layout. Right now I'm working on getting the styles just right for the menu nav section. Tomorrow I'll see if I can start getting the styles right for each of the submenus. The last 30 minutes were spent working on the JS calculator. I figured out what was wrong with the calculator display. It turns out there were syntax errors on some of the buttons due to the quotation marks I was using. Once I switched some of the quotation marks to single quotes, everything started to work just fine. The rest of the session was setting up functions to get most of the calculator functionality working. Despite the functions working, I'm back to only 7 out of 16 tests passing. This is an improvement from having 1 out of 16 passing earlier but many of the tests that are failing are things that are working on the calculator now. Tomorrow I'm going to finish the backspace function and see what other functionality I need to add to the site before I start redoing my code.

### Day 75: August 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add backspace function to JS calculator. Ran testing on JS calculator. Plan if-else statements for addToScreen function. Continued to update CSS classes on 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu website. Change classes and ids in HTML file.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were spent finishing the backspace function. I ran into lots of testing issues today. At the beginning of the session only 7 tests were passing. When I refreshed the browser and ran the tests once the backspace function was added, only 12 tests passed. I read all the tests and I think the remaining tests need to be addressed in the addtoScreen function. One of the tests that didn't pass is user story 7 with the clear button. So I moved the clear id on the HTML. I started to play around with the addToScreen function. I changed the box.value in the if statement to be 0 to blank. When the tests ran, only 10 user stories passed. I noticed that user story 7 test passed but user story 8 failed despite it working in the browser. I looked at the tests and the remaining tests that aren't passing are ones for the clear button, calculator starting with multiple zeroes, decimals, appending decimals and operation performed is the last operator entered. I replaced the box.value back to showing blank on the display. But tomorrow I'm going to play with the addtoScreen function to see if I can use if-else statements for the clear button, zeroes and decimals. I am still working on the styles for the mobile version of the menu site. Before I continued the styles on the different menu sections, I double checked the menu navigation to see if everything was working smoothly and if I needed to make any changes. The rest of the session was spent working on the menu section. I managed to get the styles done for the entrees section and start on the menu items for the main courses section. As I work on the sub menu sections, I am creating ids for each of the sections to see if this will help later when I work with the JavaScript. Tomorrow I'll see if I can finish the main courses and dessert sections before I tackle the JS. I also want to see if everything is working smoothly with the menu section's CSS before I start working on getting the functions to work correctly.

### Day 76: August 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Update JS code in script file for 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu website. Add CSS styles for events and new sections on mobile site. Created a new function for clear button on JavaScript Calculator.

**Thoughts:** In the first few minutes, I double checked all the styles I've made for the menu section. I did the remaining updates for the menu items in the main courses and dessert sections. Once these styles were done, I worked on the JavaScript and figured out why all the menus were showing instead of just one. I originally was using document.querySelector for some of my variables but I changed everything back to document.getElementByClassName. This gave me errors in the console when I opened the page in the browser. It turns out I was missing the 's' in document.getElementsByClassName. As soon as I changed this, only one menu was showing on the screen. Now that the menu section is done, I focused on getting the rest of the mobile page done. All I need to do is finish the footer styles then tomorrow I can start working on the responsive stylesheet. The last 30 minutes were spent working on the JS calculator. I created a brand new function for the clear button and copied the code I originally had for the addtoScreen function inside. This made 10 user story tests pass. I spent a lot of time reading the Free Code Camp forums and documentation to get an idea how to approach the remaining tests. I still think the solution might be in the addtoScreen function and using if-else statements to check if there are multiple zeroes. I think I might need to set the calculator to zero like I have been doing in previous versions. However I'm going to look at more documentation and forum posts to get an idea how to move forward next.

### Day 77: August 16, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finish adding styles to footer on mobile version of 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu. Add styles for medium size screens. Start adding styles for style.css file. Read JS documentation and played around with addtoScreen function for JS calculator.

**Thoughts:** I'm almost done with the restaurant menu website! Today I was able to get a large amount of the site's CSS done. The mobile version is officially done. I got the responsive styles for medium screen sizes done. I was able to get a head start on the styles for the large screens. Although I did a lot of work with the CSS, I double checked the menu section on the mobile and responsive versions to make sure everything is working correctly. Tomorrow I'll finish the restaurant menu website styles then I'll be ready to start a brand new project. Last 30 minutes didn't have too much work on the JS calculator. I spent a lot of time reading Jon Duckett's book. I did play around with the addtoScreen function to see if it would change the number instead showing 0 then the number pressed. I figured out how to do this by adding a value attribute to the display input. Inside the addtoScreen function I changed the += to equals. This allowed me to change the values when the button was pressed but now the function can't calculate anymore so I'm back to 9 out of 16 tests passing. Tomorrow I'm going to go back to the local file to see what happens if I change the form back to div tags to see if the existing code will work if it isn't in a form.

### Day 78: August 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finish CSS styles for 30 Days, 30 Sites restaurant menu. Fixed merge conflicts with README file on Github. Update input tags to div tags on local JS calculator website. Comment JS code and set up jQuery.

**Thoughts:** I finished the restaurant menu website. I added the remaining CSS to the website. I created a new class in the new section so I could add some padding between the p tags. I put the elements in the new section in a row div tag so they would display inline block on the site without setting the individual properties. The rest of the session was creating the README file for the project and fixing merge conflicts when I was pushing the code to Github. I wasn't able to start set up for the new project because of the merge conflicts but tomorrow I'll start working on the new site setup and what I'd like to work on for this site. During the last 30 minutes, I changed all the input tags on my local version of the JS calculator to div tags. This made the test go from 10 to 7 passing. I spent a lot of time looking at examples on CodePen and the Free Code Camp forums. The ones that don't use React used jQuery or just basic JS to create their calculators. So I added back jQuery to the local calculator to see if I can play around with it. I didn't delete any of my original code. I have all the code I've been working with in comments. So far I've got the document ready and have began adding the variables. Tomorrow I plan on playing with the JS a little bit and using what I'm finding in the forums to see what will help pass the tests on my calculator.

### Day 79: August 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Set up code files for 30 Days, 30 Sites author website. Start writing HTML code. Used jQuery to get calculator buttons to work.

**Thoughts:** I started a brand new project today. Today was mostly getting everything set up and ready to go for the project. I decided to not use JavaScript on this project in order to get more practice with Flexbox properties. Right now my focus is just getting the HTML up on the site. So far I've added the header and footer. I'm not sure what sections to put on my site so I looked at some real author websites to get inspiration as well as looking at the image from the movie showing the book the author wrote to see what fonts and colors to use. Tomorrow I'd like to add more sections to the site so I have enough content to practice with when it comes to playing around with the CSS. Last 30 minutes were playing around with the jQuery and using what I found in the Free Code Camp forums and projects on CodePen to see what might work on my calculator. At first the code I was using earlier was still on the HTML. This threw off all the tests and gave me one user story passing. So I removed the onclick attributes and functions. I also changed most of the divs back into buttons. When I had the jQuery working, I was able to get 12/16 user story tests to pass. As I was searching CodePen and Free Code Camp, I found a project that used code similar to the code I had been using earlier. So I commented out the jQuery code I've been using and removed the comments from my old code. So far I'm updating the addtoScreen function so everything displays on the calculator.

### Day 80: August 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Refactored functions for clear, backspace, equals and power functions in JS Calculator. Add HTML sections for news, best seller book and enchanted for 30 Days, 30 Sites author website. Add new css files for responsive styles. Start adding base styles in mobile stylesheet and header.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were spent working on the JS calculator. I refactored the remaining functions I had on my calculator. This resulted in 12 out of 16 user stories tested. I revisited my notes I wrote a few days ago with the value attribute for the display and changing the += to = in the addtoScreen function. This changed the stories from going from 12 to 9 passing. So I used the remaining sessions to review the documentation and forums. I think there is a method I'm missing in my code that will solve user story 7. I'm going to reviews some of the JS and jQuery documentation tomorrow to see what I can find. I finished all the HTML for the author website. I also found a color palette to use for the CSS. I did get a head start on some of the CSS but most of the work was getting the sections on the website. I updated some of the original sections I had yesterday. This meant switching around the first section to book-sign which will just have a background image. The original items I was using in this section were moved to other sections on the page. I finished the directory section with all the navigation for the site. the rest of the HTML were additions. I'll probably be adding more HTML along the way of this project but tomorrow I'll be concentrating on the CSS for the rest of the time.

### Day 81: August 20, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Read more JS documentation for JS calculator. Redoing HTML for calculator. Start adding styles for header section of 30 Days, 30 Sites author website.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were spent on JS calculator. I read a little bit more from Jon Duckett's book to see what might work for my calculator. After 15 minutes I spent the rest of the time looking at my code. I think the best plan of action is setting up a function for the clear button. I'm changed all the input tags back to div tags. I decided to delete the power button on my calculator. I might delete the CE button but for now I'm going to leave it on my calculator and see if I can make it work. After looking at some project examples of CodePen, I think I'm going to go back to using Babel to see if this helps the code I already have work along with jQuery. I've been googling more data attributes to use on my HTML and found the data-key attribute. I'm going to try using the data-key attribute on my calculator buttons to see if they will store the inputs when the button is clicked so I can use them in a JS function. I spent the entire session working on the header for 30 Days, 30 Sites. The header took me a lot longer than I anticipated since the previewer wasn't completely fitting on the iphone screen and the header would push itself down from the top of the page, leaving a large amount of white space near the top. I spent a lot of time looking at my CSS code to see what I could change. Right now I managed to find a working solution by changing the width from 100% to 90%. Although I spent most time on the header, I did add the background image for the book sign section to see how much space is between these two sections. Right now I see a little bit of space between these two sections. I think I'm going to remove background image and just use a regular image inside the section instead.

### Day 82: August 21, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add Flexbox properties to body in 30 Days, 30 Sites website. Finish header styles for mobile version of website. Finish updates for JS Calculator HTML. Start working on functions in script file.

**Thoughts:** I spent a lot of time working on the header section than I was planning. This was trying to figure out why there was a whitespace above the header section. I started playing around with Flexbox to see if I could find a solution with the Flexbox properties. I found a working solution by adding display property to the body and setting it to flex. Then I used flex-wrap to wrap all the elements on the page. Once I got Flexbox on the site, I added all the original styles I set yesterday back to the page one at a time. I moved the original background image I was using to an image tag in the HTML file for the book sign section. I was originally going to have a section for the newsletter but this created a lot of white space between the two sections. I spent the rest of the session playing around with the HTML for the sections including getting rid of the newsletter section and combining it with the book sign section. Tomorrow I'm going to play with the book sign section some more to see if I can get everything to work so there is no whitespace between them. The last 30 minutes were spent working on the JS calculator code. I managed to update the rest of the HTML code. I ran the tests and only had 1 test passing. This was due to all the JS functions not running. So I created blank functions in the JS file to get all the tests working. Right now I have 8 tests passing on the local calculator I'm using. I started working on getting the clear button working. Tomorrow I'm going to google to see if I can find the Redux documentation. I've seen a lot of projects in the Free Code Camp forums and CodePen use Redux so I'll see what I'm able to find. I'm not a big fan of Redux so it will be interesting to see if I can get it to work on this calculator.

### Day 83: August 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fix header, book sign and newsletter sections on mobile version of 30 Days, 30 Sites author website. Start adding styles for best-seller, enchanted and news sections. Read some of the Redux documentation. Regular expressions in Free Code Camp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures section.

**Thoughts:** Before I started working on any of the CSS, I looked at the author site through the previewer on Dev Tools. The issues I had yesterday somehow magically fixed itself. So I went back in and changed the width I set in the sections I did yesterday. After looking at the site, I decided to go back to putting the image in the book sign section as a background image. I also put the newsletter section back in a separate section tag instead of with the book-sign section. The previewer is still a little bit odd in how it displays styles but everything looks exactly the way it needs to be. The rest of the time was spent adding styles to other sections. Tomorrow I will wrap up the mobile stylesheet for this site and start working on the tablet styles for medium sized screens. I took a break from working on the JS calculator today to look over some of the Regex documentation. Based on what I read, I don't think it will help with my calculator after all. So I went back to the Free Code Camp sections to see what might help. I think the regular expressions will help with replacing some of the numbers on the calculator so I started revisiting some of the Free Code Camp lessons to see what might or might not work for the calculator. I stopped at the restrict possible usernames lesson. Tomorrow I'll finish the regular expressions review and see if there are any other lessons that might help with the JS calculator.

### Day 84: August 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finish CSS mobile stylesheet for 30 Days, 30 Sites author website. Start adding CSS styles for tablet stylesheet. Add styles for header, book-sign, and newsletter sections. Finish Regex lessons review in Free Code Camp JavaScript section. Start adding Regex for operators.

**Thoughts:** The previewer was once again acting up so I didn't use the previewer as much today and instead played around with the screen sizes with Dev Tools open. I did finish the mobile styles. I spent a lot of time trying to get the directory links to have a little padding added to the top so they would have some spacing but this wasn't working the way I wanted to so I left it the way it is. Once all the mobile styles were done, I started adding CSS to the tablet.css file. The image for the best-seller section is proving to be a challenge. Right now I'm trying to play around with the image's height. Tomorrow I'd like to play with the padding to see if I can get it to look centered with equal amounts of white space on each side of the image. Last 30 minutes were finishing up the Regex review. I have an idea how I can use it for the JS Calculator. The rest of the session was spent working on the calculator code to play around with some of the functions to see if I could get the regex to work. At the time I'm writing this entry there are 8 tests passing but that is since a lot of the code I have on my local site is currently broken. I'm going to write some pseudocode for certain part of the functions I have so I can figure out what else I might need to make my calculator work.

### Day 85: August 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finish adding CSS for tablet stylesheet for 30 Days, 30 Sites author website. Debug and refactor JS calculator functions for stylesheets. Add regex to check for operators and decimals.

**Thoughts:** The tablet version of the author site is technically done. I added the remaining CSS to the website and updated the properties so they would look nice on websites. The Dev Tools previewer is acting up again. When I checked the site in Dev Tools, everything looked exactly the way I wanted it. However the previewer is showing whitespace after the header, book sign and newsletter sections. Although I did get a head start adding details to the style.css file, I think I'm going to double check all the styles in the tablet stylesheet and see if I need to make any final fixes before I start working on the last stylesheet. The last 30 minutes were spent working on the JS calculator. I updated a lot of my JS code. I didn't run any tests. I was concentrating on seeing if everything was working using the console vs using the Free Code Camp tests. I started doing some debugging at the end of the code to resolve some of the error messages that popped up in my code. I wasn't sure how to check for the multiple decimals and zeroes so I looked at some examples on CodePen. Many people create a separate function which checks if a user is trying to use multiple zeroes and decimals. So I created a function to run through my code and check if a user is doing this. I've still got a lot of errors and the calculator is still not working so I'll be playing around some more with the local website code to see what I can do to fix everything.

### Day 86: August 25, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Review CSS styles for medium size screens for 30 Days, 30 Sites author site. Add CSS for large screen sizes of site. Fix functions for JS Calculator. Start refactoring JS code.

**Thoughts:** I put the finishing touches on the author website. I tried fixing my website using the Dev Tools previewer but wasn't having much luck. The whitespace is still showing up in the previewer at the end of each section of the website. When I changed the window sizes in Dev Tools, the site looks completely different from what is appearing in the previewer. So I just changed the screen size to match what an iPad to see how everything looked and everything was just fine. I'm not sure what is going on with the previewer so I decided move on with the rest of the site and get the CSS done for large screens. The large screen styles went just fine. I didn't have to make too many tweaks to the CSS. Once all the styles were done, I moved all the styles to CodePen. The styles look completely different on the pen than my local file. Some of the styles condensed on the CodePen file so I might go back and fix these styles in future. I am instead going to start a brand new project tomorrow just to see how this project is like in the previewer. Last 30 minutes were spent working on the JS Calculator. I spent the entire time working on the functions on my local version of my JS calculator. At the beginning of the session only 8 tests were passing. I think a lot of this comes from the variables I'm using in my calculator. So I did some debugging and refactored on some of the variables. This helped and now all my user story tests are passing. Although they are all working, I'm going to still go through the calculator JS to see if I can refactor it. Tomorrow I'm going to save all my calculator code and focus on refactoring some of the functions if possible.

### Day 87: August 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Start refactoring code for JS calculator. Update HTML & CSS code for calculator. Set up code files for 30 Days, 30 Sites movie trailer website. Start adding HTML code to website.

**Thoughts:** First 30 minutes were spent working on refactoring the JS calculator code. Right now I'm working on refactoring all the functions I'm using. I tried changing around some of the variables to make some global variables instead of local ones. This didn't work and caused some of the user stories I originally had passing to fail. I did take some time to update the HTML & CSS code. I added a brand new div class "buttons" just to group all the keys together and use the buttons class for styles. I also changed the keys class on the buttons to key. I adjusted the selectors in CSS as well as added new properties to some of the classes. I did a lot of setup for the next 30 Days, 30 Sites project. Once the code files were ready to go, I spent the rest of the time working on the HTML. I'm keeping the navigation simple this time with just a navigation bar at the top with no logo. I also added the footer at the bottom with social media icons. I started working on the sections but I'm not sure what exactly what to put on  my site. I did look at Disney's actual site for the latest movie as well as another site for Maleficent 2 to get ideas on what I can put. I'm going to think about how exactly I want to setup my site tonight then tomorrow I'll start tackling the sections of my site.

### Day 88: August 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Remove links from header navigation. Add section tags for trailer, cast and image-gallery for 30 Days, 30 Sites movie trailer website. Add more HTML to existing sections such as news and press. Debug and refactor remaining JS calculator code.

**Thoughts:** Before I started working on site, I took some time to look at fonts and sample movie trailers. I decided to keep things very simple for the movie page in regards to section but the examples gave me a good idea what might need to be on the site. I'm not going to play with fonts this time on the site since I don't think the Star Wars fonts I was looking at with look good for styling the rest of the page. I used Dev Tools to look at the fonts the real movie page is using and they are using generic san-serif fonts so I'm going to do something similar with mine. During the work session, I concentrated on the sections. I deleted a lot of the navigation links I added yesterday and kept things very simple. I added new sections to the site for the trailer, cast and image gallery. I am going to use the image gallery article Free Code Camp posted to create a CSS Grid image gallery for some of the movie images. I'm not sure how this will translate on other screen sizes but I'm going to try it and see how it goes. Tomorrow I would like to add the remaining HTML for the last div tag in the press section and get all the image gallery images ready to go so I can spend more time concentrating on the CSS. Last 30 minutes were spent debugging and refactoring JS calculator code. Most of the refactoring didn't work and instead broke all the user tests. I did use the test as an opportunity to practice ES6 a little bit. Some of the functions are arrow functions and I changed the variables to let and const. I am not 100% comfortable using ES6 so I spent most of the time trying to find documentation on Google. Right now I'm trying to figure out the best way to refactor all the if statements I'm using in various functions. I'll see if I can find some more help in the ES6 documentation. I'm going to take one last final look at the project tomorrow to do some final refactoring then I'm going to move onto a different project.

### Day 89: August 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fix Github issues for several repositories. Did a little refactoring on JS Calculator. Finish adding HTML to 30 Days, 30 Sites movie trailer website. Start adding CSS styles for mobile website.

**Thoughts:** I didn't do a lot of refactoring on my JS Calculator I was planning to do today. Although I did some refactoring on the JS functions, most of my time was spent fixing some issues with some of my Github repositories. I got several e-mails from Github today about security alerts for several repositories. So I spent time resolving the issues and looking at pull requests from Github on how to fix some of the issues. I'll still do some refactoring on the JS Calculator tomorrow to make up the time I wasn't able to do today. I finished adding the rest of the HTML to the remaining sections on the website. I changed one of the images in the img src attribute in the press section I put yesterday. I also removed the navbar class from the header. The rest of the HTML was new additions for the image gallery and the text tags for the last div tag in the press section. Once I finished the HTML, I started to add some of the CSS to the website. Right now I'm working on the header on the mobile stylesheet. Right now I'm trying to use a background color for the header but tomorrow I'd like to try using a background image and make the navigation row a different color. I get a feeling there is something from the mobile header so I spent a lot of the time trying to fix the list items and the button. The button is especially giving me trouble. I tried moving it inside of the ul tags as a list item but I think I'll move the button back outside of the ul. I might move the button to a different section. A good place for it might be the summary section. I'll try this tomorrow and see what it looks like. The previewer is still acting up but I think this is due to the images I'm using. Tomorrow I'll see how it works in Dev Tools tomorrow as I work on the rest of the header.

### Day 90: August 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Add more CSS to mobile stylesheet for 30 Days, 30 Sites movie trailer website. Update HTML with new Bootstrap classes and headline tags for sections. Made the final changes to the JS calculator project.

**Thoughts:** I got a lot done on the mobile version of the movie trailer website. Most of this time was spent revisiting code I wrote yesterday to try out some of the ideas I wrote on my todo list. I changed some of the Bootstrap classes I was using and added some headlines to sections as I went. However most of the time was spent adding CSS to various sections of the site. I managed to get the trailer, summary, and cast sections done. Tomorrow I'd like to finish the latest news section. The big challenge tomorrow will be doing the image gallery and seeing if I can get the images for the gallery to work on small screens. Last 30 minutes were spent running the final tests and making final changes to the JS Calculator. I made some final changes to some of the functions, breaking a lot of my code when I was running tests. Most of the changes were just updating some of my variables and functions so they were more descriptive and clear to someone else what my code is trying to do. I tried using as much ES6 documentation as possible. Some functions are set up exactly what I found in the ES6 documentation while others aren't. I did this on purpose because I wasn't sure my code would be easier to read that way so I left some functions with more code the way they were for now. I might change these functions later as I work more with ES6.
