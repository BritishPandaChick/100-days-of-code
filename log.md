# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a bear cub image from the Daily CSS Images challenge and playing around how to build images in CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's not as it looks. Had to refer back to the Koala example a bit for review and discovered some bugs. Fix those errors in the Koala code when I finished the bear cub code. Not quite sure if it looks like a bear cub, but it is still pretty cute.

### Day 2: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a elephant image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Used CSS to try building trunk

**Thoughts**: This one was so hard because of the trunk. I played around with the trunk and looked at a few examples, but decided to keep things simple. I added the stripes to see if it would help make it interesting. I did my best with the ears, but I might have made Mickey Mouse instead of an elephant. Played with the border-radius a bit to see if that would help and it make it less Mickey a bit.

### Day 3: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a Beaver image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Tried building a snout and teeth.

**Thoughts** I tried doing this challenge mostly on my own, but I looked at the code I previously did for reference. I even had to google some projects to see how others tried making the teeth and snout. It took some time, but I managed to get it to work a bit. Hardest part of the challenge was the snout and nose. I tried clippy as suggested from the tools in the online course the creator of the challenge recommends, but it didn't work for me so I just modified it with CSS.

### Day 4: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a tiger CSS image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Built the head, ears, eyes, and nose on my own.

**Thoughts** I did a little bit better than the beaver challenge and did most of the things on my own. I did reference back to the beaver a bit for the nose. I did have to look at other project examples to see how others did the stripes. I used on project as an example and tried to replicate it as best I could. Originally it was looking like a bright orange monkey, but the stripes helped make it a little bit better.

### Day 5: August 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS image of Mickey Mouse for the Daily CSS Images challenge. Used a sample project on CodePen to figure out how to do the mouth.

**Thoughts** Wasn't quite sure what to do for the challenge so I had to look at other projects to get an idea what I was suppose to do. Decided to make Mickey Mouse since I almost made a mouse yesterday. Overall did better building Mickey's head and ears. The biggest challenge was the smile and creating his chin. I did a quick google search to see how others made smiles and tweaked some of the code to get mine for Mickey. It doesn't quite look like Mickey Mouse. His cheeks have a chipmunk quality, but overall I was impressed with what I was able to do and make.

### Day 6: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS Clock from CSS Tricks. Finished HTML and CSS. Trying to get clock to work once it is in the browser.

**Thoughts** I looked at more examples of clocks before started this project so decided to "cheat" and try using a tutorial. I found one off of CSS Tricks and decided to try it. I've made clocks before, but this one involves moving the different hands on the clock. Currently working on getting the hands to work. Right now the minute hand stays where it is at.

### Day 7: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS Clock Code so clock hands work. Started working on Day 7 of CSS Images with the ruler image.

**Thoughts** I debugged my code for my clock I was working on yesterday. The problem was with the images and how the URL being used in the CSS. Once that was fixed, the code was running smoothly. Once I finished with the clock code, I started working on the CSS ruler. The challenge was figuring out the markings on the ruler and how to get them to appear on the page. I looked a quite a few examples and decided to try replicating one I saw on a website I googled. The problem I had with the ruler was just getting the markings to line with each other. Some were separated from the top. When I used ruler-wrapper for the class, the issue was resolved. I'll play around with the customization sometime later.

### Day 8: August 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Made a notepad for Day 8 of Daily CSS Images Challenge.

**Thoughts** Once again, looked at some of the CSS Images of notepads on CodePen to get some inspiration before I started. Decided to try replicating some of the code I've seen on CodePen. I had to google a bit of the code to understand how it works, but I managed to get my version similar to the one I was working off of on CodePen. Will try the next challenge tomorrow then switch gears and maybe try Odin Project a bit.
