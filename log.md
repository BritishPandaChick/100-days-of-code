# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Create two shooting stars in Khan Academy Project Shooting Star. Started removing code from portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** Trying to do some JavaScript animations today. The biggest issue was trying to get the stars to go into different directions. Most of the time the stars just wanted to go in the same direction. I revisited the previous lessons and took several attempts at tweaking the xPos and yPos for the different stars to get them to go into different directions. I revisited my portfolio site and started removing some of the div tags in my code for the full-width, half-width, and third-width. I made some tweaks to the head tag such as the Google fonts link and style tags. I did create an assets folder to move my stylesheets and images to live in for the project. I'm not quite sure how to tackle the portfolio site quite yet so I need to wireframe my website before I tackle more code tomorrow.
