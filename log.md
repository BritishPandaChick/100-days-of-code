# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Create two shooting stars in Khan Academy Project Shooting Star. Started removing code from portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** Trying to do some JavaScript animations today. The biggest issue was trying to get the stars to go into different directions. Most of the time the stars just wanted to go in the same direction. I revisited the previous lessons and took several attempts at tweaking the xPos and yPos for the different stars to get them to go into different directions. I revisited my portfolio site and started removing some of the div tags in my code for the full-width, half-width, and third-width. I made some tweaks to the head tag such as the Google fonts link and style tags. I did create an assets folder to move my stylesheets and images to live in for the project. I'm not quite sure how to tackle the portfolio site quite yet so I need to wireframe my website before I tackle more code tomorrow.

### Day 2: June 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Build Animal Attack Project in Khan Academy. Create animal with more JS animations. Added div tags to portfolio website.

**Thoughts:** Did more practice with JavaScript animations today. I made an animal in the Khan Academy Resizing Variables lessons. I found I was repeating code a lot often as I was putting together the animals so I went back over my code and change variables for any code I was going to repeat again. I did a little bit better job with the animations today. Originally the code in my animations was moving to the right side of the screen instead of staying in place, but I played around with the variables and numbers for the X and Y for the ellipse to keep everything in place. I started making tweaks to my portfolio website. I'm debating on adding more pages to my website and some JavaScript. I'm not sure what JavaScript to add to my website though. For now I'm going to see if I can focus on getting the HTML the way I'd like before I make bigger changes.
