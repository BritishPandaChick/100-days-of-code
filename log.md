# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a bear cub image from the Daily CSS Images challenge and playing around how to build images in CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's not as it looks. Had to refer back to the Koala example a bit for review and discovered some bugs. Fix those errors in the Koala code when I finished the bear cub code. Not quite sure if it looks like a bear cub, but it is still pretty cute.

### Day 2: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a elephant image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Used CSS to try building trunk

**Thoughts**: This one was so hard because of the trunk. I played around with the trunk and looked at a few examples, but decided to keep things simple. I added the stripes to see if it would help make it interesting. I did my best with the ears, but I might have made Mickey Mouse instead of an elephant. Played with the border-radius a bit to see if that would help and it make it less Mickey a bit.

### Day 3: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a Beaver image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Tried building a snout and teeth.

**Thoughts** I tried doing this challenge mostly on my own, but I looked at the code I previously did for reference. I even had to google some projects to see how others tried making the teeth and snout. It took some time, but I managed to get it to work a bit. Hardest part of the challenge was the snout and nose. I tried clippy as suggested from the tools in the online course the creator of the challenge recommends, but it didn't work for me so I just modified it with CSS.

### Day 4: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a tiger CSS image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Built the head, ears, eyes, and nose on my own.

**Thoughts** I did a little bit better than the beaver challenge and did most of the things on my own. I did reference back to the beaver a bit for the nose. I did have to look at other project examples to see how others did the stripes. I used on project as an example and tried to replicate it as best I could. Originally it was looking like a bright orange monkey, but the stripes helped make it a little bit better.
