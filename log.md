# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a bear cub image from the Daily CSS Images challenge and playing around how to build images in CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's not as it looks. Had to refer back to the Koala example a bit for review and discovered some bugs. Fix those errors in the Koala code when I finished the bear cub code. Not quite sure if it looks like a bear cub, but it is still pretty cute.

### Day 2: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a elephant image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Used CSS to try building trunk

**Thoughts**: This one was so hard because of the trunk. I played around with the trunk and looked at a few examples, but decided to keep things simple. I added the stripes to see if it would help make it interesting. I did my best with the ears, but I might have made Mickey Mouse instead of an elephant. Played with the border-radius a bit to see if that would help and it make it less Mickey a bit.

### Day 3: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a Beaver image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Tried building a snout and teeth.

**Thoughts** I tried doing this challenge mostly on my own, but I looked at the code I previously did for reference. I even had to google some projects to see how others tried making the teeth and snout. It took some time, but I managed to get it to work a bit. Hardest part of the challenge was the snout and nose. I tried clippy as suggested from the tools in the online course the creator of the challenge recommends, but it didn't work for me so I just modified it with CSS.

### Day 4: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a tiger CSS image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Built the head, ears, eyes, and nose on my own.

**Thoughts** I did a little bit better than the beaver challenge and did most of the things on my own. I did reference back to the beaver a bit for the nose. I did have to look at other project examples to see how others did the stripes. I used on project as an example and tried to replicate it as best I could. Originally it was looking like a bright orange monkey, but the stripes helped make it a little bit better.

### Day 5: August 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS image of Mickey Mouse for the Daily CSS Images challenge. Used a sample project on CodePen to figure out how to do the mouth.

**Thoughts** Wasn't quite sure what to do for the challenge so I had to look at other projects to get an idea what I was suppose to do. Decided to make Mickey Mouse since I almost made a mouse yesterday. Overall did better building Mickey's head and ears. The biggest challenge was the smile and creating his chin. I did a quick google search to see how others made smiles and tweaked some of the code to get mine for Mickey. It doesn't quite look like Mickey Mouse. His cheeks have a chipmunk quality, but overall I was impressed with what I was able to do and make.

### Day 6: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS Clock from CSS Tricks. Finished HTML and CSS. Trying to get clock to work once it is in the browser.

**Thoughts** I looked at more examples of clocks before started this project so decided to "cheat" and try using a tutorial. I found one off of CSS Tricks and decided to try it. I've made clocks before, but this one involves moving the different hands on the clock. Currently working on getting the hands to work. Right now the minute hand stays where it is at.

### Day 7: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS Clock Code so clock hands work. Started working on Day 7 of CSS Images with the ruler image.

**Thoughts** I debugged my code for my clock I was working on yesterday. The problem was with the images and how the URL being used in the CSS. Once that was fixed, the code was running smoothly. Once I finished with the clock code, I started working on the CSS ruler. The challenge was figuring out the markings on the ruler and how to get them to appear on the page. I looked a quite a few examples and decided to try replicating one I saw on a website I googled. The problem I had with the ruler was just getting the markings to line with each other. Some were separated from the top. When I used ruler-wrapper for the class, the issue was resolved. I'll play around with the customization sometime later.

### Day 8: August 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Made a notepad for Day 8 of Daily CSS Images Challenge.

**Thoughts** Once again, looked at some of the CSS Images of notepads on CodePen to get some inspiration before I started. Decided to try replicating some of the code I've seen on CodePen. I had to google a bit of the code to understand how it works, but I managed to get my version similar to the one I was working off of on CodePen. Will try the next challenge tomorrow then switch gears and maybe try Odin Project a bit.

### Day 9: August 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a calendar for Day 8 of Daily CSS Images Challenge. Use the tutorial on W3schools.com to make a monthly calendar.

**Thoughts** I wanted to make a simple calendar so I did some googling before I decided to build this project. I found this tutorial on W3schoools and decided to try making it with them. Overall it was a better experience making this project. Will be switching from Daily CSS Images to projects on Odin Project tomorrow to see how those go before returning to the Daily CSS Image challenge. All that is left to do for this project is play with the fonts and colors.

### Day 10: August 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on election map for Skillcrush 102 review. Started to debug code.

**Thoughts** I did start Odin Project, but there wasn't enough project building for me to write a post for today and I didn't want to jump ahead with Odin so I worked on the election map bonus project from the updated Skillcrush 102. This map was already a work in progress before I did this challenge so most of the code was already done. I just added more variables, objects, and methods to figure out the state winners. Did some work on debugging my code and did find some errors. I will continue debugging code to see if I can find the error later. JavaScript itself is tough for me and this challenge was tough for that reason. I still need some JavaScript practice so hopefully I can push through the Odin Project more tomorrow.

### Day 11: August 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started building a portfolio for 30 Days, 30 Sites Challenge. Built most of site. Adding more customizations and changing colors.

**Thoughts** Still working on getting Odin Project ready to go, but there are some extra things I need to do before I can start doing the projects. In the mean time, I'm trying out the 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge by doing the portfolio (the first project). I looked at the sample site and tried out the sample site code to see how they did parts of the site. After working on that code, I'm taking the things I liked about the site and translating it to my own portfolio site. This is a newer version of my previous portfolio site so I'm playing with the colors and layout a bit more. There are some things I liked from the sample site that I'm going to keep using, but I'm slowly making changes to the site to have it fit my personality a bit more.  I'm still working on my site right now. I'll try playing with it a bit more and finish up this site tomorrow.

### Day 12: August 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Putting finishing touches on portfolio site from Day 11. Started working on event invitation for 30 Days, 30 Sites Challenge.

**Thoughts** Added some last minute final touches to the portfolio site I was working on for Day 11 and added the link to the log. Spent most of my time building an event invitation. I looked at the sample site and the one on W3schools to see how to tackle this project. After looking at the demo and the code for the demo a bit, I started picking and choosing which elements I wanted for my site on CodePen. Currently working on getting just the right header for my website. I couldn't get the background image to appear at first, then when it did appear I didn't like the look with a text. I'm going to keep things simple and just use simple background colors with the text.

**Link(s) to work**: [Event Invitation-Day 2](https://codepen.io/BritishPandaChick/full/eEPQza/)

### Day 13: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on event invitation project for Day 12. Debugging code for Election Map and Magic 8 Ball for Skillcrush 102 review.

**Thoughts** Worked a little bit more on the event invitation project form Day 12. Changed the images, added some colors, and tweaked some of the content. The project isn't perfect, but I'm much happier with the look. I might go back and change colors of the headlines so they work with the images. Instead of starting a new project, I took time go get back to debug my magic 8 ball code and election map code I've been working on for the Skillcrush 102 review I'm doing with a few other Skillcrush alumni. With the magic 8 ball, I tweaked some of the functions and manage to get the message to appear. The only thing I need to do know for the magic 8 ball is figure out how to get the message inside the actual magic 8 ball. I double checked all my code, but wasn't able to figure out what was causing it to act up. I took a break and went back to the election map. This time I was able to get all the states to change colors, showing the candidate names, and picking a winner. The only problem was the colors belonging to the second candidate weren't showing up on the map. I think the problem is in one of the functions so I'll need to double check the JavaScript again to see if I can find the error.

### Day 14: August 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a pencil jar for Daily CSS Images challenge. Used CSS to add a few pencils inside the jar.

**Thoughts** Decided to do another CSS images for today's project. I found it helpful when I look at other examples on CodePen since it gives me a better idea of what I need to make. After looking at a couple of examples, I picked one I liked and tried replicating the code as best as I could. The biggest challenge was making the pencils. One of the pencils was outside of the jar so it took me some time playing top margin, width, and height to get the pencil in the jar.

### Day 15: August 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a pizza for the Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** After looking through the project prompt e-mails in my inbox, I decided to make a pizza for the Daily CSS Images. I looked a few sample projects to get some inspiration, but I mostly did this project on my own. I didn't want to make a regular pizza so I had a little fun decorating my pizza. I kept my design pretty simple so I could focus on getting the right shape and size for the elements I was working with. It isn't perfect and I'll try adding black lines in the future to show the slices.

### Day 16: September 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started building a tourist attraction website for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge. I finished most of the HTML. Did some CSS work for navigation and map.

**Thoughts** Looked at the sample website and a few CodePen examples before I started. I decided to make a fictional tourist attraction website for Storybrooke, Maine. The biggest challenge building this website was knowing what to put on the home page for a tourist attraction. I put in placeholders for things I'd like to add, but most of the focus was just putting most of the HTML on the site. I took some time to play with the CSS to get the navigation bar ready. I put a map to the real life location on my site. I changed the width to expand the map on the website. Biggest challenge has been the image at the top of the site. It isn't quite centered, but I'll play around with it as I keep building my website.

### Day 17: September 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished building tourist attraction website for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge. Added images. Used bootstrap to create website layout.

**Thoughts** Finished building tourist attraction site. Used the sample site as a model to figure out what features I wanted on my site. This is the best project I've done using bootstrap. Although the navigation and footer need to span over the entire page, I'm satisfied with the look of the project and have gotten better using bootstrap since I used it to build my first version of my portfolio.

### Day 18: September 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a hamburger with HTML & CSS for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** Looked at more sample projects of burgers before I started building this project. I saw similar project on CodePen, but I only borrowed a bit of CSS just to make the top bun. Only issue was getting the positioning of the different toppings in between the two buns. I played around with the margins a bit before getting the toppings underneath each other. I switched around some of the div tags so the meat was on the bottom instead of the top. Originally the meat was the first div and tomato was the last, but I switched the order around so it would be easier working in CSS.

### Day 19: September 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a taco using CSS for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** After looking at some sample projects, I decided to try replicating one of the taco projects I saw on CodePen. The project doesn't quite look like an actual taco, but I managed to get it as similar to the one seen on CodePen and an actual taco. The biggest challenge was doing the tomato and cheese. Originally I was trying to get the tomato to appear, but nothing appeared. Once I added the background color and some shadow, bits of the tomato started to appear. This made it look like there were multiple slices instead of just one appearing. Today's project makes it clear I need to learn more about box shadows and how they work in CSS.

### Day 20: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started building a product site for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge. Used flexbox tutorial to get images aligned and next to each other on website.

**Thoughts** Worked mostly on the HTML for product site. Looked at a few sample projects on CodePen to see how others tackled the project as well as looking at the sample project included in the e-mail. Did most of the HTML today for the site. Spent most of my time reading the flexbox tutorial from the e-mail and trying to get the images to appear on the site side by side. One of the images is not the same size as the others so I might get rid of the last row and just keep the original 3 images I have. I feel like there is something else missing on the page, but I'm going to try keeping this product side very simple. I'll play around with some of the code when I finish the style for the site. I started some of the CSS, but I decided to stop and focus on getting most of my code up and ready to go.

### Day 21: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed HTML for product site challenge. Concentrated on doing CSS style for website.

**Thoughts** Add a few more div tags and removed the last row of images from the product site. I also deleted the store image I included in the header. Most difficult part of today's tasks was figuring out if I needed to include more information on my site. The website is fairly simple, but I don't think the client I had in mind designing this website for would want a lot of detail and instead put attention on the objects. Another tough part of the website was finding the right colors for all the elements on the site. I decided to stick with gold, but I wanted to use colors from the signs featured on the storefront. I used a clippy tool to find colors closest to the ones used on the signs and used them as backgrounds for the nav, header, and footer.

### Day 22: September 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a cheesecake for Daily CSS Image challenge using only CSS.

**Thoughts** This challenge took me a lot longer than the hour requirement. The problem I had with my cheesecake were the sides. The sides of the cheesecake were much bigger than the top. I played with the height on the top and sides to see why they weren't fitting together to look like a whole cheesecake. A couple hours later, I realized I needed to set the width of the side to 67.5% instead of just 67%. Once I changed the width measurement, everything started to fit the right way. I need to make sure I double check my measurements since I typed in the measurements wrong on a few of the cherries.

### Day 23: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a slice of pie for Daily CSS Image challenge.

**Thoughts** After looking at some sample projects others have done, I tried building something similar to one of the examples I found on CodePen. Decided to go with a basic pie. Originally was planning on having a whipped cream topping, but wasn't having much luck getting it to appear on the browser. Decided to scrap the whipped cream after trying for an hour. The pie filling itself was originally a challenge because it wasn't appearing in CodePen. I double checked my code and discovered I missed a . before the pie class name. Once I made the changes, everything started to appear like a pie slice.

### Day 24: September 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished debugging magic 8 ball. Started to debug election map script file.

**Thoughts** I have been meaning to debug some of my JavaScript projects I've been working on. I finally figured out what was wrong with the magic 8 ball. The problem with my magic 8 ball was in one of the src links in the JavaScript file. The src link was to the wrong image. I started to work on my election map, but I'm having a harder time finding out what is wrong with my map. I double checked the HTML & CSS to see if there were any errors with the election map there, but didn't find anything. The error most likely is in the script file in one of the functions used to tally up the votes. JavaScript is tough, but I'm getting better at reading the code and understanding what it is trying to do.

### Day 25: September 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made Frankenstein for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I saw a really cute CodePen image I wanted to try replicating for Franken-bear for this project, but I wasn't having much luck and decided to scrap it. After looking at more images for inspiration, I found an example to try replicating. Had problems getting the stitches and one of the bolts to line up correctly. After playing with the margins as best as I could, I decided to scrap the stitches for the face. I left the right bolt the way it is. It doesn't match the one on the left, but I might revisit this project later and play with the margins on the bolts to see if I can get it to work.

### Day 26: September 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a Zombie face for the Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** While looking at examples on CodePen, I found a great zombie design that seemed interesting to try. Originally it wasn't working out and I was ready to scrap the entire project. The problem was the face was just a sideways circle with two outlines for the mouth. I took a look at some of the code for the project I was inspired by and discovered another div tag was used to help move the face down towards the middle of the page. Once I added the container div tag, the shapes I originally had on the browser started to come together to make the face.

### Day 27: September 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a vampire for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I found a great example of a vampire head on CodePen that I wanted to replicate, but the head was too small. I decided to play around with the width and height on many of the elements to see if I could improve the size so it was a little bit bigger. The challenge for today's project was the teeth. The teeth were still pretty small and it was hard finding the right size so they were visible. As I finished the project, I noticed the head is not quite in the center of the page but has shift a bit to the right. For now, I'm satisfied with what I made. I might go back later and see if I can add some changes to the margins so the head can be a little more in the center of the page.

### Day 28: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Editing and customizing my personal portfolio site. Made revisions to the home page and changed the menu for the portfolio site.

**Thoughts** Taking a break from making projects to start making changes to my portfolio site. I deleted some of the older pages and got rid of my current blog on the website. I'm planning on re-doing the blog into something more tech related once I'm done revising some of the previous pages. For now I'm putting my focus into building the home page of my site. I was hoping to do more of the portfolio site today, but I'll get to the other pages as I go. The challenge of the home page was just figuring out the right layout for the content and what should be on the home page. I looked at a few examples and decided to make my home page my current portfolio page where users could see my best projects. I added a brief bio at the top of the home page and made a contact section at the bottom for the call of action.

### Day 29: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on restaurant menu site. Made header for the website and started work on the actual menu section.

**Thoughts** I really liked the templates from W3 Schools that I wanted to do another for another site. I decided to use the pizza menu template for the restaurant menu. So far I've been able to make the header of the website. I'm not doing all the parts of the template, but borrowing the header and menu. The header looks quite nice. I'll need to play around with the CSS on some of the elements once I'm done with the menu. I started work on the menu by dividing the tabs into breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So far I've been working on adding the food items to the breakfast section, but they haven't appeared on the preview. Tomorrow I'm going to look through the code to see what could be causing the bug and try to fix it.

### Day 30: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished making menu. Found issues with the header and nav bar. Added some JavaScript to make the menu items appear on web page.

**Thoughts** Consulted the W3schools template to see what was wrong with my menu and realized their page worked with some JavaScript. Added a function to get the menu items to appear in the menu area of the web page. Once I added the function, everything started to appear on the page. Besides adding new content, I added more menu items to the menu and changed some of the text in the header area.

### Day 31: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a monster for Daily CSS Images. Tried making the staypuft marshmallow man from the original Ghostbusters movie.

**Thoughts** I wasn't quite sure what monster to make, but I decided to make the staypuft marshmallow man's face since I had marshmallows on the brain and the facial design itself was very simple to make. Everything started off well on CodePen with the face. I did a really good job on the eyes and getting the head. I did some googling and looked at some of my previous projects to see how to do the mouth. I ultimately found a tutorial on Google and based my mouth on the design they used. The biggest struggle is the hat. I was playing with the transform property in CSS, but I was having a hard time getting the top and middle to get close to each other with the margins. I did the best I could, but it doesn't quite fit on the side of the head like the one in the movie.

### Day 32: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a werewolf for Daily CSS Images.

**Thoughts** I wanted to make a basic werewolf for this project and played around the face before going to CodePen for inspiration. I found one example I liked and tried to mimic what was done in the code. The biggest challenge was the mouth. I wasn't having much luck making a werewolf mouth I liked. I instead went back to my vampire images code and borrowed the mouth code I used from there to make the mouth.

### Day 33: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Make basic version of superman from CodePen design.

**Thoughts** I wasn't sure how to tackle this project so I wanted to try replicating one of the animated CodePen designs I saw for the challenge. This design was pretty basic especially for the face and body. My goal was just to get the face and body to appear. After I achieved this, I did try playing around to see if I could get the S symbol to appear on his body, but I only got a straight line of yellow and black. I decided to scrap the work I made on the S and just include a link of what I was able to accomplish with the head and body. Despite the challenges, I think I'm getting better at understanding some of the newer CSS means in some of the CodePen designs and am getting more courage playing with the Clippy tool the challenge suggests.

### Day 34: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the logo of Green Lantern using CSS.

**Thoughts** I saw a really good example of the logo on CodePen that I wanted to try replicating for the basic design. Only problem making the logo was that one of the sides of the logo wasn't appearing. I double checked the CSS and HTML, but wasn't able to find the error at first. I eventually realized I misspelled width property for the middle of my lantern logo. Once I fixed my mistake, the entire circle appeared instead of a C shape. I'll have to be extra careful as I work with CSS in the future.

### Day 35: September 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made Wolverine's face in CSS.

**Thoughts** I saw another great design on CodePen that I tried replicating on my own. The sides of the mask were uneven. The left side was shorter than the right side. After looking at the code, I wasn't able to figure it out. I eventually figured it out by commenting out sections of the code to look for errors. I particularly focused on left and right sections of the mask to see why one size was small. It turns out the left side div tag was using the wrong punctuation mark. Once I fixed it, the left side was the same size as the right.

### Day 36: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished debugging the election map for the JavaScript 102 review.

**Thoughts** Before I started changing my code, I read things over to see if I could spot any misspellings. I ran a test to see what areas I should look at first. The states that were a draw were one of the areas I was uncertain so I knew I needed to check the party colors and state winner functions. I saw other members of the JavaScript 102 group had maps with all the states changing colors so I knew that was a priority. At first I wasn't able to find anything wrong. I decided to change the factory function I wrote at the beginning to see if that would help. However I forgot to change one of the variables in one of the functions so none of the colors appeared on the map. I figured out which one I missed and fixed things right away. Then it was back to searching for the error. It took me a while, but I found it in the party color function. I added rgb in front of the [] which wasn't needed in the if-else statement. Once I removed the rgb, the states that were a DRAW finally changed color to blue.

### Day 37: September 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited Codeacademy HTML website for HTML & CSS course.

**Thoughts** I've been meaning to redo some of my code and upload some of my projects to separate repositories on Github. I went on CodePen to my Codeacademy site I made when I originally started Codeacademy and made some changes to some of the code. I added new HTML tags to get the code organized and used this project as an opportunity to play around with some of the CSS. I did try out some Bootstrap, but I scrapped it after playing around with some of the paragraphs.

### Day 38: September 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited Social Profile project for Codeacademy HTML & CSS course.

**Thoughts** I decided to try playing around with more Bootstrap for today's project goal. I wanted to update the social profile website I made from Codeacademy so I used it as an opportunity to play around with bootstrap and add some CSS style to the project. The biggest problem was the background. On CodePen, the gray background shows up just fine. However the code on my computer won't show the gray background. Instead the background is still white which makes it hard to see any of the content. I tested my code JSFiddle and JSBin where all my code is working just fine in the browser. I'm going to have to look at the head tag on my files to see if there is anything missing that could be affecting why the background color isn't appearing on my site.

### Day 39: September 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made Iron Man's mask using HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts** I found a great example of Iron Man's mask on CodePen and did my best trying to replicate the design. The mask isn't as simple as it looks since there are so many corners on the mask. The biggest challenge was just getting the gold part of the mask to look less like blocks trying to connect with each other. The rotate property took some time to play with the different degrees, but I double checked my code with the one in the original CodePen file and found I was getting close to what was in the original.

### Day 40: September 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made Captain America's shield using HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts** I wanted to make Captain America's shield for this challenge and looked at how some of the other people tackled this challenge on CodePen. I decided to replicate one of the designs on CodePen. The challenge was the star on the shield. The star wasn't coming together on my shield. I knew I probably had a misspelling somewhere in my code since the parts of the star were appearing in the output, but they weren't together. I looked at each of the properties, but I focused on the border properties to see if there was a misspelling. I finally found it in one of the border properties for shield-star. Once I fixed this error, it started to look like a star.

### Day 41: September 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited clickable photo page project from Codeacademy.

**Thoughts** Some of the images from my original attempt at this project were no longer available so I decided to update the project with new content. I added new links to images and used CSS to change the colors of the table and the table header. Added a footer at the bottom of the page and was going to do a white background, but decided to keep thing simple when the footer wouldn't extend the full length of the page. The only thing I will need to play around with are the images. The size of the images are too big that it makes a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom. I will see if I can make the images smaller so the horizontal bar will disappear.

### Day 42: September 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited Design a Button project. Add footer and fixed borders. Edited Sort Friends project.

**Thoughts** I did two projects today instead of one since both tasks were easy and didn't have much changes to make. I spent most of my time playing around with the button project to see if I could improve the design with CSS. Although I played with the size, I went with the original look. Biggest challenge was getting the text in the button to not be too close to the border. I played with the top padding to get the right spacing between the two. Sorting friends project was mostly changing around the content. I did fix the CSS for the div tags so the text wasn't rising to the top of the circle.

### Day 43: September 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a book/author website for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge.

**Thoughts** I was originally planning on just using HTML & CSS to make this site. After reading the challenge notes, I decided to use this project as an opportunity to play with Bootstrap. The website itself is very simple because of that reason. The challenge with the Bootstrap is when my footer kept trying to rise up along with some of my sections. I tried changing the class names, but the best way which worked for me was just closing the container div tag. Once I closed my first container div tag, the footer stayed at the bottom of the page.

### Day 44: September 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edit resume website project from Codeacademy HTML & CSS section.

**Thoughts** I added some structure tags to the HTML to keep different areas organized (i.e. footer, header, sections). I added the copyright info at the bottom of the web page. On the stylesheet, I played around with the style especially the dimensions for the width and height. I changed the font sizes, colors, and font families. Added margins and position to some of the sections.

### Day 45: September 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated and debugged Codeacademy Address Book from Codeacademy JavaScript section.

**Thoughts** When I looked at the code I originally had for this project, almost all my functions were missing. So I decided to try this project again as extra project and debug the code I had left. This project took some time because I kept getting an undefined error in the console saying "Bob undefined" or "Mary undefined". I tried changing around some of the functions, but this resulted in the tests saying Steve Jobs wasn't added to the array. An hour later, I realized lastName was written as lastname in one of the functions. Once I changed this, the last names started to appear in the console on CodePen.

### Day 46: October 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added HTML file for cash register project. Updated cash register code.

**Thoughts** I added an HTML file for the cash register project then spent most of my time debugging my code. I kept getting a reference error for the staff discounts so I spent most of my time looking at this area to see if I could find an error. I realized I was using the wrong variable when I was trying to call the function later in my code. Once I changed "me" to "sarah", the code started to show the total. Besides fixing errors, I added comments to help keep my code organized and document progress.

### Day 47: October 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated and edited Code Your Own Adventure game from Codeacademy JavaScript section. Made icon of choice for Daily CSS Images.

**Thoughts** Added an HTML page to Code Your Own Adventure Game, but spent most of the time debugging the JavaScript in the console. There weren't too many errors in the game file, so I made an icon from the Daily CSS Images. I decided to replicate the app store icon from a project I saw on CodePen. The pencil and the line were not in the right positions. I debugged my code and looked to see if there were any issues when I realized I put erase instead of eraser in the style sheet. Once I made changes, everything started to work just fine.

### Day 48: October 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug 2nd Code Your Own Adventure Game. Debug contact list. Both projects from Codeacademy JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Debugged two JavaScript projects today. Added two new HTML files for both projects. Changed some of the names in Code Your Adventure Game. Took extra time to read code to understand what the code was trying to do.

### Day 49: October 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug dragon slayer game from Codeacademy JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Added new HTML file. Initial test said one of the variables was undefined. Found that the variable for damageThisRound missing a d. Changed the variable and double checked the variable in the while statement to see if there were any misspellings.

### Day 50: October 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the safari icon using HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts** When I made my last icon for the Daily CSS Images challenge, I saw this safari icon someone made on CodePen that I almost made instead for day 47. Today I was in the mood to make something instead of debugging just code so I decided to make the safari icon I had seen before. This project was a challenge because of the triangles on the compass of the icon. I had to look at what the author did for his code to see how he managed to get the triangles close to each other. Had trouble getting the E to get to move from the left to the right, but was able to find the error quickly and fix it.

### Day 51: October 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug rock, paper, scissors game for Codeacademy JavaScript section.

**Thoughts** Created a brand new HTML file for project, but most focus was on debugging the code. Reading the JS code I wrote as I debug helps me get a better understanding what the code is doing. Played around with some of the number values for the computerChoice's if-else statement to see what happened in my code.

### Day 52: October 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug Codeacademy Search Text for Name project from JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Added HTML file. Debugged the for loop in the script file. Need to be careful with the semi-colons. I missed one in the for loop and got an error when I did some testing.

### Day 53: October 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug drop down menu project from Codeacademy jQuery section. Made cogs for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** Quickly debug drop down menu project. Used the extra time to make some cogs for the Daily CSS Images challenge. I didn't want to use animation for the cogs, but I found a project I wanted to replicate on CodePen. The challenge was getting the cogs to look less like * and more like a cog. I had to play around with the degrees for the cogs to get mine to look similar to the project inspiration I was using. Upon looking at the inspiration code, I noticed they used .cog + .cog to make individual edges of the cog. I tried this in my code and it made things so much easier.
