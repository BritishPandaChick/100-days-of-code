# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a bear cub image from the Daily CSS Images challenge and playing around how to build images in CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's not as it looks. Had to refer back to the Koala example a bit for review and discovered some bugs. Fix those errors in the Koala code when I finished the bear cub code. Not quite sure if it looks like a bear cub, but it is still pretty cute.
