# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a bear cub image from the Daily CSS Images challenge and playing around how to build images in CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's not as it looks. Had to refer back to the Koala example a bit for review and discovered some bugs. Fix those errors in the Koala code when I finished the bear cub code. Not quite sure if it looks like a bear cub, but it is still pretty cute.

### Day 2: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a elephant image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Used CSS to try building trunk

**Thoughts**: This one was so hard because of the trunk. I played around with the trunk and looked at a few examples, but decided to keep things simple. I added the stripes to see if it would help make it interesting. I did my best with the ears, but I might have made Mickey Mouse instead of an elephant. Played with the border-radius a bit to see if that would help and it make it less Mickey a bit.

### Day 3: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a Beaver image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Tried building a snout and teeth.

**Thoughts** I tried doing this challenge mostly on my own, but I looked at the code I previously did for reference. I even had to google some projects to see how others tried making the teeth and snout. It took some time, but I managed to get it to work a bit. Hardest part of the challenge was the snout and nose. I tried clippy as suggested from the tools in the online course the creator of the challenge recommends, but it didn't work for me so I just modified it with CSS.

### Day 4: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a tiger CSS image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Built the head, ears, eyes, and nose on my own.

**Thoughts** I did a little bit better than the beaver challenge and did most of the things on my own. I did reference back to the beaver a bit for the nose. I did have to look at other project examples to see how others did the stripes. I used on project as an example and tried to replicate it as best I could. Originally it was looking like a bright orange monkey, but the stripes helped make it a little bit better.

### Day 5: August 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS image of Mickey Mouse for the Daily CSS Images challenge. Used a sample project on CodePen to figure out how to do the mouth.

**Thoughts** Wasn't quite sure what to do for the challenge so I had to look at other projects to get an idea what I was suppose to do. Decided to make Mickey Mouse since I almost made a mouse yesterday. Overall did better building Mickey's head and ears. The biggest challenge was the smile and creating his chin. I did a quick google search to see how others made smiles and tweaked some of the code to get mine for Mickey. It doesn't quite look like Mickey Mouse. His cheeks have a chipmunk quality, but overall I was impressed with what I was able to do and make.

### Day 6: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS Clock from CSS Tricks. Finished HTML and CSS. Trying to get clock to work once it is in the browser.

**Thoughts** I looked at more examples of clocks before started this project so decided to "cheat" and try using a tutorial. I found one off of CSS Tricks and decided to try it. I've made clocks before, but this one involves moving the different hands on the clock. Currently working on getting the hands to work. Right now the minute hand stays where it is at.

### Day 7: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS Clock Code so clock hands work. Started working on Day 7 of CSS Images with the ruler image.

**Thoughts** I debugged my code for my clock I was working on yesterday. The problem was with the images and how the URL being used in the CSS. Once that was fixed, the code was running smoothly. Once I finished with the clock code, I started working on the CSS ruler. The challenge was figuring out the markings on the ruler and how to get them to appear on the page. I looked a quite a few examples and decided to try replicating one I saw on a website I googled. The problem I had with the ruler was just getting the markings to line with each other. Some were separated from the top. When I used ruler-wrapper for the class, the issue was resolved. I'll play around with the customization sometime later.

### Day 8: August 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Made a notepad for Day 8 of Daily CSS Images Challenge.

**Thoughts** Once again, looked at some of the CSS Images of notepads on CodePen to get some inspiration before I started. Decided to try replicating some of the code I've seen on CodePen. I had to google a bit of the code to understand how it works, but I managed to get my version similar to the one I was working off of on CodePen. Will try the next challenge tomorrow then switch gears and maybe try Odin Project a bit.

### Day 9: August 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a calendar for Day 8 of Daily CSS Images Challenge. Use the tutorial on W3schools.com to make a monthly calendar.

**Thoughts** I wanted to make a simple calendar so I did some googling before I decided to build this project. I found this tutorial on W3schoools and decided to try making it with them. Overall it was a better experience making this project. Will be switching from Daily CSS Images to projects on Odin Project tomorrow to see how those go before returning to the Daily CSS Image challenge. All that is left to do for this project is play with the fonts and colors.

### Day 10: August 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on election map for Skillcrush 102 review. Started to debug code.

**Thoughts** I did start Odin Project, but there wasn't enough project building for me to write a post for today and I didn't want to jump ahead with Odin so I worked on the election map bonus project from the updated Skillcrush 102. This map was already a work in progress before I did this challenge so most of the code was already done. I just added more variables, objects, and methods to figure out the state winners. Did some work on debugging my code and did find some errors. I will continue debugging code to see if I can find the error later. JavaScript itself is tough for me and this challenge was tough for that reason. I still need some JavaScript practice so hopefully I can push through the Odin Project more tomorrow.

### Day 11: August 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started building a portfolio for 30 Days, 30 Sites Challenge. Built most of site. Adding more customizations and changing colors.

**Thoughts** Still working on getting Odin Project ready to go, but there are some extra things I need to do before I can start doing the projects. In the mean time, I'm trying out the 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge by doing the portfolio (the first project). I looked at the sample site and tried out the sample site code to see how they did parts of the site. After working on that code, I'm taking the things I liked about the site and translating it to my own portfolio site. This is a newer version of my previous portfolio site so I'm playing with the colors and layout a bit more. There are some things I liked from the sample site that I'm going to keep using, but I'm slowly making changes to the site to have it fit my personality a bit more.  I'm still working on my site right now. I'll try playing with it a bit more and finish up this site tomorrow.

### Day 12: August 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Putting finishing touches on portfolio site from Day 11. Started working on event invitation for 30 Days, 30 Sites Challenge.

**Thoughts** Added some last minute final touches to the portfolio site I was working on for Day 11 and added the link to the log. Spent most of my time building an event invitation. I looked at the sample site and the one on W3schools to see how to tackle this project. After looking at the demo and the code for the demo a bit, I started picking and choosing which elements I wanted for my site on CodePen. Currently working on getting just the right header for my website. I couldn't get the background image to appear at first, then when it did appear I didn't like the look with a text. I'm going to keep things simple and just use simple background colors with the text.

**Link(s) to work**: [Event Invitation-Day 2](https://codepen.io/BritishPandaChick/full/eEPQza/)

### Day 13: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on event invitation project for Day 12. Debugging code for Election Map and Magic 8 Ball for Skillcrush 102 review.

**Thoughts** Worked a little bit more on the event invitation project form Day 12. Changed the images, added some colors, and tweaked some of the content. The project isn't perfect, but I'm much happier with the look. I might go back and change colors of the headlines so they work with the images. Instead of starting a new project, I took time go get back to debug my magic 8 ball code and election map code I've been working on for the Skillcrush 102 review I'm doing with a few other Skillcrush alumni. With the magic 8 ball, I tweaked some of the functions and manage to get the message to appear. The only thing I need to do know for the magic 8 ball is figure out how to get the message inside the actual magic 8 ball. I double checked all my code, but wasn't able to figure out what was causing it to act up. I took a break and went back to the election map. This time I was able to get all the states to change colors, showing the candidate names, and picking a winner. The only problem was the colors belonging to the second candidate weren't showing up on the map. I think the problem is in one of the functions so I'll need to double check the JavaScript again to see if I can find the error.

### Day 14: August 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a pencil jar for Daily CSS Images challenge. Used CSS to add a few pencils inside the jar.

**Thoughts** Decided to do another CSS images for today's project. I found it helpful when I look at other examples on CodePen since it gives me a better idea of what I need to make. After looking at a couple of examples, I picked one I liked and tried replicating the code as best as I could. The biggest challenge was making the pencils. One of the pencils was outside of the jar so it took me some time playing top margin, width, and height to get the pencil in the jar.

### Day 15: August 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a pizza for the Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** After looking through the project prompt e-mails in my inbox, I decided to make a pizza for the Daily CSS Images. I looked a few sample projects to get some inspiration, but I mostly did this project on my own. I didn't want to make a regular pizza so I had a little fun decorating my pizza. I kept my design pretty simple so I could focus on getting the right shape and size for the elements I was working with. It isn't perfect and I'll try adding black lines in the future to show the slices.

### Day 16: September 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started building a tourist attraction website for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge. I finished most of the HTML. Did some CSS work for navigation and map.

**Thoughts** Looked at the sample website and a few CodePen examples before I started. I decided to make a fictional tourist attraction website for Storybrooke, Maine. The biggest challenge building this website was knowing what to put on the home page for a tourist attraction. I put in placeholders for things I'd like to add, but most of the focus was just putting most of the HTML on the site. I took some time to play with the CSS to get the navigation bar ready. I put a map to the real life location on my site. I changed the width to expand the map on the website. Biggest challenge has been the image at the top of the site. It isn't quite centered, but I'll play around with it as I keep building my website.

### Day 17: September 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished building tourist attraction website for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge. Added images. Used bootstrap to create website layout.

**Thoughts** Finished building tourist attraction site. Used the sample site as a model to figure out what features I wanted on my site. This is the best project I've done using bootstrap. Although the navigation and footer need to span over the entire page, I'm satisfied with the look of the project and have gotten better using bootstrap since I used it to build my first version of my portfolio.

### Day 18: September 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a hamburger with HTML & CSS for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** Looked at more sample projects of burgers before I started building this project. I saw similar project on CodePen, but I only borrowed a bit of CSS just to make the top bun. Only issue was getting the positioning of the different toppings in between the two buns. I played around with the margins a bit before getting the toppings underneath each other. I switched around some of the div tags so the meat was on the bottom instead of the top. Originally the meat was the first div and tomato was the last, but I switched the order around so it would be easier working in CSS.

### Day 19: September 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a taco using CSS for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** After looking at some sample projects, I decided to try replicating one of the taco projects I saw on CodePen. The project doesn't quite look like an actual taco, but I managed to get it as similar to the one seen on CodePen and an actual taco. The biggest challenge was doing the tomato and cheese. Originally I was trying to get the tomato to appear, but nothing appeared. Once I added the background color and some shadow, bits of the tomato started to appear. This made it look like there were multiple slices instead of just one appearing. Today's project makes it clear I need to learn more about box shadows and how they work in CSS.

### Day 20: September 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started building a product site for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge. Used flexbox tutorial to get images aligned and next to each other on website.

**Thoughts** Worked mostly on the HTML for product site. Looked at a few sample projects on CodePen to see how others tackled the project as well as looking at the sample project included in the e-mail. Did most of the HTML today for the site. Spent most of my time reading the flexbox tutorial from the e-mail and trying to get the images to appear on the site side by side. One of the images is not the same size as the others so I might get rid of the last row and just keep the original 3 images I have. I feel like there is something else missing on the page, but I'm going to try keeping this product side very simple. I'll play around with some of the code when I finish the style for the site. I started some of the CSS, but I decided to stop and focus on getting most of my code up and ready to go.

### Day 21: September 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed HTML for product site challenge. Concentrated on doing CSS style for website.

**Thoughts** Add a few more div tags and removed the last row of images from the product site. I also deleted the store image I included in the header. Most difficult part of today's tasks was figuring out if I needed to include more information on my site. The website is fairly simple, but I don't think the client I had in mind designing this website for would want a lot of detail and instead put attention on the objects. Another tough part of the website was finding the right colors for all the elements on the site. I decided to stick with gold, but I wanted to use colors from the signs featured on the storefront. I used a clippy tool to find colors closest to the ones used on the signs and used them as backgrounds for the nav, header, and footer.

### Day 22: September 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a cheesecake for Daily CSS Image challenge using only CSS.

**Thoughts** This challenge took me a lot longer than the hour requirement. The problem I had with my cheesecake were the sides. The sides of the cheesecake were much bigger than the top. I played with the height on the top and sides to see why they weren't fitting together to look like a whole cheesecake. A couple hours later, I realized I needed to set the width of the side to 67.5% instead of just 67%. Once I changed the width measurement, everything started to fit the right way. I need to make sure I double check my measurements since I typed in the measurements wrong on a few of the cherries.

### Day 23: September 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a slice of pie for Daily CSS Image challenge.

**Thoughts** After looking at some sample projects others have done, I tried building something similar to one of the examples I found on CodePen. Decided to go with a basic pie. Originally was planning on having a whipped cream topping, but wasn't having much luck getting it to appear on the browser. Decided to scrap the whipped cream after trying for an hour. The pie filling itself was originally a challenge because it wasn't appearing in CodePen. I double checked my code and discovered I missed a . before the pie class name. Once I made the changes, everything started to appear like a pie slice.

### Day 24: September 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished debugging magic 8 ball. Started to debug election map script file.

**Thoughts** I have been meaning to debug some of my JavaScript projects I've been working on. I finally figured out what was wrong with the magic 8 ball. The problem with my magic 8 ball was in one of the src links in the JavaScript file. The src link was to the wrong image. I started to work on my election map, but I'm having a harder time finding out what is wrong with my map. I double checked the HTML & CSS to see if there were any errors with the election map there, but didn't find anything. The error most likely is in the script file in one of the functions used to tally up the votes. JavaScript is tough, but I'm getting better at reading the code and understanding what it is trying to do.

### Day 25: September 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made Frankenstein for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I saw a really cute CodePen image I wanted to try replicating for Franken-bear for this project, but I wasn't having much luck and decided to scrap it. After looking at more images for inspiration, I found an example to try replicating. Had problems getting the stitches and one of the bolts to line up correctly. After playing with the margins as best as I could, I decided to scrap the stitches for the face. I left the right bolt the way it is. It doesn't match the one on the left, but I might revisit this project later and play with the margins on the bolts to see if I can get it to work.

### Day 26: September 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a Zombie face for the Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** While looking at examples on CodePen, I found a great zombie design that seemed interesting to try. Originally it wasn't working out and I was ready to scrap the entire project. The problem was the face was just a sideways circle with two outlines for the mouth. I took a look at some of the code for the project I was inspired by and discovered another div tag was used to help move the face down towards the middle of the page. Once I added the container div tag, the shapes I originally had on the browser started to come together to make the face.

### Day 27: September 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a vampire for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I found a great example of a vampire head on CodePen that I wanted to replicate, but the head was too small. I decided to play around with the width and height on many of the elements to see if I could improve the size so it was a little bit bigger. The challenge for today's project was the teeth. The teeth were still pretty small and it was hard finding the right size so they were visible. As I finished the project, I noticed the head is not quite in the center of the page but has shift a bit to the right. For now, I'm satisfied with what I made. I might go back later and see if I can add some changes to the margins so the head can be a little more in the center of the page.

### Day 28: September 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Editing and customizing my personal portfolio site. Made revisions to the home page and changed the menu for the portfolio site.

**Thoughts** Taking a break from making projects to start making changes to my portfolio site. I deleted some of the older pages and got rid of my current blog on the website. I'm planning on re-doing the blog into something more tech related once I'm done revising some of the previous pages. For now I'm putting my focus into building the home page of my site. I was hoping to do more of the portfolio site today, but I'll get to the other pages as I go. The challenge of the home page was just figuring out the right layout for the content and what should be on the home page. I looked at a few examples and decided to make my home page my current portfolio page where users could see my best projects. I added a brief bio at the top of the home page and made a contact section at the bottom for the call of action.

### Day 29: September 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started working on restaurant menu site. Made header for the website and started work on the actual menu section.

**Thoughts** I really liked the templates from W3 Schools that I wanted to do another for another site. I decided to use the pizza menu template for the restaurant menu. So far I've been able to make the header of the website. I'm not doing all the parts of the template, but borrowing the header and menu. The header looks quite nice. I'll need to play around with the CSS on some of the elements once I'm done with the menu. I started work on the menu by dividing the tabs into breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So far I've been working on adding the food items to the breakfast section, but they haven't appeared on the preview. Tomorrow I'm going to look through the code to see what could be causing the bug and try to fix it.

### Day 30: September 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished making menu. Found issues with the header and nav bar. Added some JavaScript to make the menu items appear on web page.

**Thoughts** Consulted the W3schools template to see what was wrong with my menu and realized their page worked with some JavaScript. Added a function to get the menu items to appear in the menu area of the web page. Once I added the function, everything started to appear on the page. Besides adding new content, I added more menu items to the menu and changed some of the text in the header area.

### Day 31: September 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a monster for Daily CSS Images. Tried making the staypuft marshmallow man from the original Ghostbusters movie.

**Thoughts** I wasn't quite sure what monster to make, but I decided to make the staypuft marshmallow man's face since I had marshmallows on the brain and the facial design itself was very simple to make. Everything started off well on CodePen with the face. I did a really good job on the eyes and getting the head. I did some googling and looked at some of my previous projects to see how to do the mouth. I ultimately found a tutorial on Google and based my mouth on the design they used. The biggest struggle is the hat. I was playing with the transform property in CSS, but I was having a hard time getting the top and middle to get close to each other with the margins. I did the best I could, but it doesn't quite fit on the side of the head like the one in the movie.

### Day 32: September 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a werewolf for Daily CSS Images.

**Thoughts** I wanted to make a basic werewolf for this project and played around the face before going to CodePen for inspiration. I found one example I liked and tried to mimic what was done in the code. The biggest challenge was the mouth. I wasn't having much luck making a werewolf mouth I liked. I instead went back to my vampire images code and borrowed the mouth code I used from there to make the mouth.

### Day 33: September 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Make basic version of superman from CodePen design.

**Thoughts** I wasn't sure how to tackle this project so I wanted to try replicating one of the animated CodePen designs I saw for the challenge. This design was pretty basic especially for the face and body. My goal was just to get the face and body to appear. After I achieved this, I did try playing around to see if I could get the S symbol to appear on his body, but I only got a straight line of yellow and black. I decided to scrap the work I made on the S and just include a link of what I was able to accomplish with the head and body. Despite the challenges, I think I'm getting better at understanding some of the newer CSS means in some of the CodePen designs and am getting more courage playing with the Clippy tool the challenge suggests.

### Day 34: September 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the logo of Green Lantern using CSS.

**Thoughts** I saw a really good example of the logo on CodePen that I wanted to try replicating for the basic design. Only problem making the logo was that one of the sides of the logo wasn't appearing. I double checked the CSS and HTML, but wasn't able to find the error at first. I eventually realized I misspelled width property for the middle of my lantern logo. Once I fixed my mistake, the entire circle appeared instead of a C shape. I'll have to be extra careful as I work with CSS in the future.

### Day 35: September 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made Wolverine's face in CSS.

**Thoughts** I saw another great design on CodePen that I tried replicating on my own. The sides of the mask were uneven. The left side was shorter than the right side. After looking at the code, I wasn't able to figure it out. I eventually figured it out by commenting out sections of the code to look for errors. I particularly focused on left and right sections of the mask to see why one size was small. It turns out the left side div tag was using the wrong punctuation mark. Once I fixed it, the left side was the same size as the right.

### Day 36: September 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished debugging the election map for the JavaScript 102 review.

**Thoughts** Before I started changing my code, I read things over to see if I could spot any misspellings. I ran a test to see what areas I should look at first. The states that were a draw were one of the areas I was uncertain so I knew I needed to check the party colors and state winner functions. I saw other members of the JavaScript 102 group had maps with all the states changing colors so I knew that was a priority. At first I wasn't able to find anything wrong. I decided to change the factory function I wrote at the beginning to see if that would help. However I forgot to change one of the variables in one of the functions so none of the colors appeared on the map. I figured out which one I missed and fixed things right away. Then it was back to searching for the error. It took me a while, but I found it in the party color function. I added rgb in front of the [] which wasn't needed in the if-else statement. Once I removed the rgb, the states that were a DRAW finally changed color to blue.

### Day 37: September 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited Codeacademy HTML website for HTML & CSS course.

**Thoughts** I've been meaning to redo some of my code and upload some of my projects to separate repositories on Github. I went on CodePen to my Codeacademy site I made when I originally started Codeacademy and made some changes to some of the code. I added new HTML tags to get the code organized and used this project as an opportunity to play around with some of the CSS. I did try out some Bootstrap, but I scrapped it after playing around with some of the paragraphs.

### Day 38: September 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited Social Profile project for Codeacademy HTML & CSS course.

**Thoughts** I decided to try playing around with more Bootstrap for today's project goal. I wanted to update the social profile website I made from Codeacademy so I used it as an opportunity to play around with bootstrap and add some CSS style to the project. The biggest problem was the background. On CodePen, the gray background shows up just fine. However the code on my computer won't show the gray background. Instead the background is still white which makes it hard to see any of the content. I tested my code JSFiddle and JSBin where all my code is working just fine in the browser. I'm going to have to look at the head tag on my files to see if there is anything missing that could be affecting why the background color isn't appearing on my site.

### Day 39: September 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made Iron Man's mask using HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts** I found a great example of Iron Man's mask on CodePen and did my best trying to replicate the design. The mask isn't as simple as it looks since there are so many corners on the mask. The biggest challenge was just getting the gold part of the mask to look less like blocks trying to connect with each other. The rotate property took some time to play with the different degrees, but I double checked my code with the one in the original CodePen file and found I was getting close to what was in the original.

### Day 40: September 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made Captain America's shield using HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts** I wanted to make Captain America's shield for this challenge and looked at how some of the other people tackled this challenge on CodePen. I decided to replicate one of the designs on CodePen. The challenge was the star on the shield. The star wasn't coming together on my shield. I knew I probably had a misspelling somewhere in my code since the parts of the star were appearing in the output, but they weren't together. I looked at each of the properties, but I focused on the border properties to see if there was a misspelling. I finally found it in one of the border properties for shield-star. Once I fixed this error, it started to look like a star.

### Day 41: September 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited clickable photo page project from Codeacademy.

**Thoughts** Some of the images from my original attempt at this project were no longer available so I decided to update the project with new content. I added new links to images and used CSS to change the colors of the table and the table header. Added a footer at the bottom of the page and was going to do a white background, but decided to keep thing simple when the footer wouldn't extend the full length of the page. The only thing I will need to play around with are the images. The size of the images are too big that it makes a horizontal scroll bar at the bottom. I will see if I can make the images smaller so the horizontal bar will disappear.

### Day 42: September 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edited Design a Button project. Add footer and fixed borders. Edited Sort Friends project.

**Thoughts** I did two projects today instead of one since both tasks were easy and didn't have much changes to make. I spent most of my time playing around with the button project to see if I could improve the design with CSS. Although I played with the size, I went with the original look. Biggest challenge was getting the text in the button to not be too close to the border. I played with the top padding to get the right spacing between the two. Sorting friends project was mostly changing around the content. I did fix the CSS for the div tags so the text wasn't rising to the top of the circle.

### Day 43: September 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a book/author website for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge.

**Thoughts** I was originally planning on just using HTML & CSS to make this site. After reading the challenge notes, I decided to use this project as an opportunity to play with Bootstrap. The website itself is very simple because of that reason. The challenge with the Bootstrap is when my footer kept trying to rise up along with some of my sections. I tried changing the class names, but the best way which worked for me was just closing the container div tag. Once I closed my first container div tag, the footer stayed at the bottom of the page.

### Day 44: September 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Edit resume website project from Codeacademy HTML & CSS section.

**Thoughts** I added some structure tags to the HTML to keep different areas organized (i.e. footer, header, sections). I added the copyright info at the bottom of the web page. On the stylesheet, I played around with the style especially the dimensions for the width and height. I changed the font sizes, colors, and font families. Added margins and position to some of the sections.

### Day 45: September 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated and debugged Codeacademy Address Book from Codeacademy JavaScript section.

**Thoughts** When I looked at the code I originally had for this project, almost all my functions were missing. So I decided to try this project again as extra project and debug the code I had left. This project took some time because I kept getting an undefined error in the console saying "Bob undefined" or "Mary undefined". I tried changing around some of the functions, but this resulted in the tests saying Steve Jobs wasn't added to the array. An hour later, I realized lastName was written as lastname in one of the functions. Once I changed this, the last names started to appear in the console on CodePen.

### Day 46: October 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added HTML file for cash register project. Updated cash register code.

**Thoughts** I added an HTML file for the cash register project then spent most of my time debugging my code. I kept getting a reference error for the staff discounts so I spent most of my time looking at this area to see if I could find an error. I realized I was using the wrong variable when I was trying to call the function later in my code. Once I changed "me" to "sarah", the code started to show the total. Besides fixing errors, I added comments to help keep my code organized and document progress.

### Day 47: October 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated and edited Code Your Own Adventure game from Codeacademy JavaScript section. Made icon of choice for Daily CSS Images.

**Thoughts** Added an HTML page to Code Your Own Adventure Game, but spent most of the time debugging the JavaScript in the console. There weren't too many errors in the game file, so I made an icon from the Daily CSS Images. I decided to replicate the app store icon from a project I saw on CodePen. The pencil and the line were not in the right positions. I debugged my code and looked to see if there were any issues when I realized I put erase instead of eraser in the style sheet. Once I made changes, everything started to work just fine.

### Day 48: October 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug 2nd Code Your Own Adventure Game. Debug contact list. Both projects from Codeacademy JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Debugged two JavaScript projects today. Added two new HTML files for both projects. Changed some of the names in Code Your Adventure Game. Took extra time to read code to understand what the code was trying to do.

### Day 49: October 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug dragon slayer game from Codeacademy JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Added new HTML file. Initial test said one of the variables was undefined. Found that the variable for damageThisRound missing a d. Changed the variable and double checked the variable in the while statement to see if there were any misspellings.

### Day 50: October 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the safari icon using HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts** When I made my last icon for the Daily CSS Images challenge, I saw this safari icon someone made on CodePen that I almost made instead for day 47. Today I was in the mood to make something instead of debugging just code so I decided to make the safari icon I had seen before. This project was a challenge because of the triangles on the compass of the icon. I had to look at what the author did for his code to see how he managed to get the triangles close to each other. Had trouble getting the E to get to move from the left to the right, but was able to find the error quickly and fix it.

### Day 51: October 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug rock, paper, scissors game for Codeacademy JavaScript section.

**Thoughts** Created a brand new HTML file for project, but most focus was on debugging the code. Reading the JS code I wrote as I debug helps me get a better understanding what the code is doing. Played around with some of the number values for the computerChoice's if-else statement to see what happened in my code.

### Day 52: October 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug Codeacademy Search Text for Name project from JavaScript course.

**Thoughts** Added HTML file. Debugged the for loop in the script file. Need to be careful with the semi-colons. I missed one in the for loop and got an error when I did some testing.

### Day 53: October 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug drop down menu project from Codeacademy jQuery section. Made cogs for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** Quickly debug drop down menu project. Used the extra time to make some cogs for the Daily CSS Images challenge. I didn't want to use animation for the cogs, but I found a project I wanted to replicate on CodePen. The challenge was getting the cogs to look less like * and more like a cog. I had to play around with the degrees for the cogs to get mine to look similar to the project inspiration I was using. Upon looking at the inspiration code, I noticed they used .cog + .cog to make individual edges of the cog. I tried this in my code and it made things so much easier.

### Day 54: October 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug jQuery button project from Codeacademy jQuery section. Started working on day 7 trailer/movie page for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge.

**Thoughts** Debug jQuery button project code. Once I finished, I started working on the trailer/movie page for 30 Days, 30 Sites. I worked on most of the basic structure of the website. I didn't stick to the original color palette used for the movie but played around with a color palette from colorpalettes.net that looked a little more festive. Managed to find a font closest to the one used for the movie. Originally was going to have a h3 tag in the header indicating it is based on a true story, but removed it in favor of adding the poster instead. Not quite sure what else to add to the website. Thinking about moving the release date up on the website. Will put finishing touches on site tomorrow.

### Day 55: October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finish trailer/movie page for 30 Days, 30 Sites Challenge.

**Thoughts** Removed the release date from the navigation and added section for the cast. Added em tags for titles of movies. I might set list-style-type to none so the bullets don't appear for the cast, but for now I don't mind the bullets. Spent most of the time working on the CSS. Although it was fairly simple, I looked at other movie pages and noticed they are keeping everything on the page since most work will come from social media. Therefore I used this opportunity to play with the margins, padding, and even the float property for some of the elements. I played around with the preset width and height for the video so it would be bigger on the website.

### Day 56: October 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug sliding panel project for Codeacademy jQuery.

**Thoughts** Debug all code files and did testing. The jQuery wasn't working on my project when I tested locally in the browser so I double checked all the code in my script file to see if it was working. I couldn't find any errors in the script file so I double checked the CSS to see if the problem was coming from the CSS. Once I got to the HTML, I eventually realized I used link href for the link the jQuery instead of script src. I changed this in the head tag and the sliding panel began to work. Going back to double check previous projects and make changes.

### Day 57: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug sprite project from Codeacademy jQuery section. Started to work on celebrity fan page.

**Thoughts** Debug all code files for jQuery section. Made sure the head tag links to the jQuery said script this time. Used the extra time to start working on celebrity fan page. Had a hard time figuring out what celebrity I wanted to make a fan page for. I went back through different celebrities, but the common problem was not having enough content to make a website. I ultimately went back to my original idea which is making a fan page for Colin Firth. Managed to make the navigation, header, and footer. Wasn't able to accomplish too much coding since I kept making and deleting code for different celebrities.

### Day 58: October 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished celebrity fan page for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge.

**Thoughts** After giving extra thought to the project, I decided to change around the navigation and completely redesign the home page. I decided to put all the content for news on the home page as an unordered list. I embed a movie trailer onto the home page, trying to think of the call to action (CTA) that might be on a fan page for any website. Used rest of the time to play with the CSS and play with bootstrap. This included changing margins for the news content and playing around with some of the bootstrap elements for the header and container.

### Day 59: October 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug to do list for Codeacademy jQuery project. Made download button for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** Debug all the code files for the last jQuery project. The jQuery project had an extra }); near the end which caused some errors in the test. Once I removed this set, I was able to get the project to work. I used the extra time to make the next project in the Daily CSS Images challenge. I looked at a few sample projects to see how others tackled the download button and found one I wanted to replicate. I didn't add any JavaScript to this project, but I used the time to practice working with CSS. I used the project inspiration to google some of the properties being used to understand what they do and tried using them in my code.

### Day 60: October 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug all Ruby projects for Codeacademy Ruby course.

**Thoughts** Updated all the Ruby projects from the Codeacademy course. Used the projects as an opportunity to review some of the Ruby concepts and what was happening in the code.

**Today's Progress**: Debug all the Python projects I've done so far the Codeacademy Python course.

**Thoughts** Updated all Python projects I've completed so far from the Codeacademy course. Did a lot more review on some of the Python concepts. I'm planning on returning to Python sometime soon.

### Day 62: October 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug first version of Free Code Camp tribute page project. Made a bar graph for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I started to debug some of the Free Code Camp projects. I fixed any bugs and errors on my original tribute page. Once I finished with the tribute page, I made a bar graph using HTML & CSS. I looked at a several different CodePen projects for inspiration and found one that was a tutorial on making an animated bar graph. I replicated the bar graph and added a h1 tag. I had to google some of the directions the tutorial wanted to understand what the code was suppose to do in the project, but I'm starting to become much more familiar with some of the CSS used to create animations and shapes.

### Day 63: October 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug Free Code Camp personal portfolio page. Made JavaScript logo for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** Debug the first version of my portfolio site project I made for Free Code Camp. Now that I have a better sense of Bootstrap and CSS, I'm planning on making a better version of my portfolio site in the future. There weren't too many errors, but I did find some bugs which made things appear differently when I test the portfolio site locally than the one in CodePen. Once I finished, I pushed the project to Github. I used the rest of my time to build a CSS version of the JavaScript logo. I did use another CodePen project as reference especially with how they did the container for the text.

### Day 64: October 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Start building children's toy and game website. Added most of the HTML to the website.

**Thoughts** Started working on the HTML for a brand new website. I wasn't quite sure how to approach the home page so I looked at the actual website the company uses to sell the dolls. Originally planned on giving separate pages for the dolls, but decided to try adding buttons onto the web page. Right now the buttons aren't functional. I'll have to play with the JavaScript to see if I can get them to work for another website.

### Day 65: October 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on children's toy and game website. Focused on making buttons work on site.

**Thoughts** Made a few changes to the HTML, but mostly added CSS to different sections. I moved the about us link in the navigation to the bottom nav menu. Most attention was playing with the buttons. I was going to try doing the buttons with CSS, but the google research suggested I stick with HTML & CSS instead. I tried playing around with the margins and padding for some of the sections, but I decided to keep things simple after trying different combinations.

### Day 66: October 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Wrote HTML for next week's blog post coding tutorial. Add extracted images to website. Put images, links and assets on web page.

**Thoughts** I did all the HTML for this Skillcrush portfolio project from Skillcrush 101. I made a version of this project before, but I'm doing this again for my blog post this week. I extracted all the images from the design files and put all HTML code in the index.html file. I copied all the code to a CodePen file so readers can reference back to the project throughout the posts to see how the site comes together. Overall it went ok. Only part that was challenging was the id in the footer. I reference back to my original code to see what I did before.

### Day 67: October 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the angular logo for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I found a CodePen project to try replicating on CodePen. The biggest challenge was the top of the logo. One of the details did not appear when I test my project. The issue came from one of the hex codes for one of the details. I comment out the rest of my code to best spot the issue and looked over each CSS property to find it. I added an extra number in one of the hex codes. Once I removed the extra number, the top detail appeared.

### Day 68: October 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the Vue JS logo for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I never heard of Vue JS before so I read a bit about it in the link included from the e-mail. This project was another opportunity to play around with the shapes. It took a couple of tries, but I eventually found the right shapes for the logo. Even after I figured out the right measurements for the triangles, I still played around with the sizes of the shapes to try out different combinations.

### Day 69: October 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the React logo for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** Looked at a few projects on CodePen before trying to replicate this project as well as reading about React from the link included in the email. I decided to play around with box shadow a bit. I removed it from my original design since it made the logo look like it was neon glowing. The biggest challenge with today's project was getting the logo itself to not rise up at the top of the page. During the CodePen full page test, the logo was cut off at the top from the top of the window. I did look at the inspiration code I used to see what the author did then played around with some of those elements in my code to get it to work.

### Day 70: October 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made the Elm logo for Daily CSS Images Challenge.

**Thoughts** Did some research on the logo for today's challenge and looked a few CodePen projects to see how I could tackle the logo. There were lots of different shapes in the logo which made it good for practicing the transform and clip-path properties. The challenge was getting the shapes to get right beside each other. I had to play with the right, top, and bottom properties on many of the elements to find the right fit.

### Day 71: October 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS holiday tree using a tutorial from CodeNewbie member.

**Thoughts** I originally tried making this project last year, but I decided to redo this project and add a little more detail. I was much more picky with the CSS on this project to get the branches on top of each other and getting the star under the name on top of the site. I looked at the github repository to see what others have done with the star and made some tweaks to the CSS top property. I was going to add some ornaments to the tree, but I spent more time on the garland and decided to keep the project simple instead.

### Day 72: October 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Add HTML to CSS Viking Christmas Tree tutorial. Start adding the project CSS.

**Thoughts** Yesterday's project was originally based on this code so I decided to try this tutorial to see what I came up with. There wasn't a lot of HTML to add to this project so most of my time was spent on the CSS. The end result was my tree trunk in the middle of the page while the star is in the upper left hand corner while the tree branches are in the bottom left. I double checked the tutorial project code, but I keep getting the same results. I might have to revisit each section slowly and try playing with some of the CSS properties to see if I can get the branches on top of the trunk.

### Day 73: October 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a testimonial slider from Skillcrush code along.

**Thoughts** Skillcrush did a code along alumni activity Friday afternoon. I wasn't able to attend the live event, but I took time today to do the coding activity. The project right now doesn't work on my computer. After taking to add code to the style and JS files, the project will only show a white screen with arrows. I started double checking the CSS especially with what was shown on the video demonstrations for the rest of the time. I will check out the JS file and the little bit of JS code on the HTML file tomorrow.

### Day 74: October 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug CSS Viking Holiday Tree project. Played with CSS to get the CSS properties bottom, margins, width, height, and position to get a tree.

**Thoughts** After looking at the tutorial code and my current code on CodePen, I decided to redo the CSS styles completely. I tackled each part of the tree one at a time to play around with the CSS. I decided to revisit my code project from the first tree I made to help me with the CSS. The challenge was getting the star to sit right on top of the tree. I had to play around with the width, height, and bottom properties for these elements to get everything into place. My project doesn't look quite like the original tutorial, but it looks more like a tree than what I originally had.

### Day 75: October 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug testimonial slider project. Changed HTML, CSS, and JS files. Manage to get background working on project but slider won't run.

**Thoughts** I double checked every variable used in the slider to make sure I had the right variables for both the HTML and the JS. After checking the variables, I started to check each line of code in all the code files. The HTML didn't have too many errors besides the wrong src link for the JS file. I made most of the changes to CSS and the JS files. The CSS file had rgb instead of rgba and one of the hex codes was incorrect. Once I made those changes, the background went from white to the coral-pink background used in the code along. When I test the slider in the browser, none of the text appears. Only the arrows and the dots appear where they don't work. I double check the Skillcrush simple slider github repository and made some more changes, but the issue still is happening. I get a feeling the issue is in the CSS rather than the JS file, but I'm triple checking both files again to see what the problem is.

### Day 76: October 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS pumpkin. Debug more code from testimonial project.

**Thoughts** I did a little debugging on the testimonial slider. I found a few spelling errors with the currentIndex variable. However it didn't fix the problem. I decided to take a break and build something for Halloween. I decided to make a CSS pumpkin for Halloween. I found a tutorial on codeplayer.com and tried coding along with the tutorial. I made a few errors. Most of these errors were for the eyes and mouth where I mixed up numbers for the border-radius property. Some of the properties had 0 0 100% 0 for both sides when only side needed this number combination. Once I made the combination 0 0 0 100%, the mouth started to even out instead of looking like a physical copy.

### Day 77: November 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made blinking holiday lights using HTML & CSS.

**Thoughts** I'm still trying to get familiar with some of the CSS properties especially ones which have the -webkit. The biggest mistake I made was not naming my ul tag strand at the beginning of the project. I was concentrated on making sure I had the right number of li tags and getting the right numbers for the box shadow properties that I forgot to name the ul class strand. Once I realized my error, I was able to quickly fix it. I still don't quite understand the :nth-child and how it works in CSS. I'll see if CSS tricks has some tips or do some research on Google to learn more.

### Day 78: November 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Began doing the CSS style for Skillcrush portfolio site for blog site. Did base styles, about, header, contact, and work section CSS styles.

**Thoughts** I began working on the CSS for the portfolio site I'm building as part of my blog series My Coding Journey. I added all the CSS styles for all the different sections and put comments documenting each section. I managed to do all the sections. I had to go into the HTML file to add a few ID tags in the contact section. The rest of the time was trying to get the same project to work on CodePen. I added the CSS from the main.css file to the CSS section, but the normalize.css file wasn't working quite right. I am playing around with external links to the normalize file mentioned in the normalize.css documentation to see if that works. So far most of it seems to work except for the e-mail in the contact section of the CodePen file.

### Day 79: November 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a snowing effect website from Codeplayer.com website.

**Thoughts** I wanted to get more practice working with JavaScript today so I looked at Codeplayer.com to see what JavaScript tutorials they had. This tutorial was great JavaScript practice. Originally my code wasn't working in the browser. I double checked some of my code and tried moving around some of the functions, but it didn't fix the problem. Instead it created more problems. I realized I spelled clearRect as clearReact, giving me the error with the snowflakes. Some of the tutorial code I was unfamiliar with so I had to do some research to see what specific parts of the code does. I must remember to be careful with the {} and the semi-colons when working with JavaScript since those contributed to many of the errors for this project.

### Day 80: November 4, 2017

**Today's Progress** Made a To Do list using HTML & CSS from Codeplayer.com tutorials.

**Thoughts** I wanted to try making a simple to do list and found a tutorial on codeplayer.com website. The challenge was getting the checkboxes to work. My original project was different from the demo project since my checkmarks were different from the ones in the sample. I double checked the CSS to see if I could find any errors. I found a few, but those didn't get the boxes for the checkmarks to disappear. I went back to check my HTML file and see if there was anything I could find. It turns out the error was in the HTML all along with one an s missing from one of the class names.

### Day 81: November 5, 2017

**Today's Progress** Debug Skillcrush testimonial slider. Made a cell phone for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** Did some more debugging on the Skillcrush testimonial. Add some more comments and checked some of the functions. I looked at another Github repository to see if I could find anymore errors with my code, but didn't have much luck. I sent a message to one of the developers who made the testimonial for help. Besides debugging the testimonial slider, I made a cell phone from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Right now most of the phone is done. The only problem is the camera at the top and speaker need to be moved towards the right. I will see if I can fix some of the measurements tomorrow.

### Day 82: November 6, 2017

**Today's Progress** Debug cell phone project code. Made laptop for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I managed to fix the camera and speaker at the top of the phone. It took a couple of tries and commenting out sections of code, but I knew the problem was in the CSS for the speaker code. I experimented with different speaker combination techniques before I finally got the speaker aligned with the camera. Once I finished debugging the cell phone project, I made a laptop for the Daily CSS Images challenge. Only made a few errors in this project so it was easier to debug than the cell phone. The biggest mistake I made was simply misspelling border for one of the border properties so the border-radius didn't work.

### Day 83: November 7, 2017

**Today's Progress** Made an external monitor for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I wanted to make a basic external monitor, but I wanted to look at some sample projects to get inspiration. I took the opportunity to play with the border-radius property a bit by trying out the border-top-left-radius and border-top-right-radius before finding the right measurement for the border-radius property. At first I was using the wrong property name so none of the corners would be rounded when I tested my website.

### Day 84: November 8, 2017

**Today's Progress** Debug testimonial slider project.

**Thoughts** I got some feedback from one of the developers who made the testimonial slider on Slack last night so I'm going to run more tests and debug my slider project today. I found some more misspellings which were harder to spot in my code then copied my code into JSBin to see if I could spot more errors. I got more reference errors as well as errors in general. So I looked back at the github repository for the code to double check for more errors. Midway through checking it, I decided to double check my code through the dev tools. This gave me much better clarification on where errors were, telling me what lines the errors were at and what type of error it is. One of these errors was a missing ) when I was trying to make the slide active. Once I added the ) in, I checked my code in the browser and the testimonial slider began working. I copied the same code in CodePen and JSBin to see if it worked. It didn't work. I double checked my project again using the dev tools console but no errors popped up. I'm not sure why the errors were apeparing in JSBIN or CodePen, but I'll keep playing around with the code to see if I can figure out why.

### Day 85: November 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made an animated CSS sun from codeplayer.com tutorials.

**Thoughts** I looked at some more codeplayer.com tutorials and made the sun tutorial. This tutorial uses CSS animations, which I often try to stay away from when I do the challenges. The biggest frustration with this tutorial was my sun not looking like a sun once I finished the code along. Instead my looked like a bunch of boxes in a line spinning. I double checked the animation, assuming I put the wrong spelling for some of the CSS properties used to get the boxes to spin. Those weren't the problem so I went back to my HTML to see if I could find any problems with the ID names. Once I started looking at the CSS properties for the sun and rings, I found a few errors. The biggest reason why the rings weren't spinning was a spacing issue with the height property for the #sun, #sun * :before, and #sun * :after properties. I didn't put spaces between the * and the : so none of the div tags were lying on top of each other.

### Day 86: November 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug Skillcrush website. Began building keyboard for Daily CSS Images.

**Thoughts** I double checked one of my Skillcrush projects I made when I started learning how to code and discovered lots of bugs. I double checked the HTML & CSS files and made changes. The background disappeared a bit, but it went back to normal once the img src was changed. After debugging and committing these changes to github, I began working on a keyboard for the Daily CSS Images challenge. I just did the HTML for today. I had to look at my keyboard a bit to make sure I got the write keys. I looked at how another developer did their keys on their keyboard and found his approach was easier than what I was doing so I changed my approach of using br tags in between keys that had two symbols.

### Day 87: November 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Add CSS to the keyboard for the Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** The keyboard was very tricky. I often had to reference and use the sample project I found on CodePen to see how they managed to get items to appear a specific way on the browser. I found myself often revisiting the HTML to double check the classes and making sure they matched the CSS selectors. The final product isn't quite perfect. There is more space on the bottom than the top, but I'm happy it looks like an actual keyboard. This project shows I just need to be much more careful with using multiple div tags since lots of the problems with this project came from the extra div tags.

### Day 88: November 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started HTML content for Once Upon a Time site. Start making a Nintendo 2Ds for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I originally made an Once Upon a Time fan site when I began coding. I decided to update the website with brand new code and give it a brand new look. I managed to complete the header, navigation, and footer for my site in 25 minutes. I added a bit of CSS to map out potential placement of these elements on my site. After 25 minutes, I started making a Nintendo 2DS. I looked at a few sample projects on CodePen and found one I'd like to try and replicate. So far I've managed to do most of the HTML. I started the CSS and so far my version looks like the buttons and screen are moving towards the left. I'm not quite done with the 2DS. I still have to put more features on the site as well as validate my CSS to see what is causing the issues with CSS right now.

### Day 89: November 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finish Nintendo 2Ds for Daily CSS Images Challenge. Finish the CSS style sheet and debug code.

**Thoughts** I finished putting all the CSS for all the features on the 2Ds. Most of the features had repeating code so I was able to copy-paste some of the repeating hex codes for the colors. Once the CSS style sheet was finished, I went back into my code to see if I could figure out what the problem was with all the elements moving towards the left. I tried validating my code, but I think the results weren't correct so I decided to do the comment sections code out and see what the problem was. I used the inspiration code to help me spot some of the errors. It turns out the problem was in several of the () where I put the - as a negative number instead of subtracting the percentage from the pixel amount. Once I changed this for the screen and some of the features, everything moved to the right spots.

### Day 90: November 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Add structure and content to Photographer website. Started to add grid system for website.

**Thoughts** My goal for today's project was getting all the HTML content on the site. I cheated a bit and borrowed the layout from a previous project I made earlier for the different sections. Most of this project is heavily based on the sample project included in the e-mail. I based a lot of the site on the sample site's features. The only HTML left to add to the site are the images. I tried using a background image for my site, but I didn't like how it mixed with the logo and navigation. I instead used a background color and tried finding a hex code similar to the town sign. I'll see tomorrow if I can add an background image underneath tomorrow. I didn't do too much with the CSS today. My goal was to get as much of the content done as possible and I think I was able to achieve that.

### Day 91: November 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Add most of the CSS to photographer website. Add images to HTML file.

**Thoughts** I spent most of the hour working on the CSS. I was going to use this project as a way to try some of the mobile responsive techniques I learned on Codeacademy, but I scrapped that idea since I ran into a problem with the CSS for the shopping, contact, and footer areas. After the events section, everything started to mix together instead of get on a separate line. Originally the events section wouldn't be separated into two, but I played with the padding a bit to get the right size. I was going to get rid of the bullet points for the dates, but the text-decoration didn't work so I'm just left the bullet points there for now. I might revisit them later when this project is done. Although I didn't do much work on the HTML, I did add some of the image links for the img tags. I'm satisfied with everything for the header, features, and exhibits. I just can't seem to get the shop, contact, and footer to get near the bottom without messing with the grid system. I'll see if I can go into dev tools to figure out what is the problem.

### Day 92: November 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finish photographer website. Fixed CSS for the entire website.

**Thoughts** Managed to fix the problem with the overlapping sections at the bottom of the pages. I believe the problem is with the floating which messed up some of the other elements. I found the best way to do this without changing everything on my site was setting the height, margins, and padding for different classes. Height particularly made the biggest difference and even caused some of the elements to move on their own.

### Day 93: November 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made Panda mascot for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I have a little bobble head figure of a panda wearing glasses that I've been meaning to try replicating in code. Since this is a potential mascot idea for a startup, I decided to try translating the face into HTML & CSS. Before tackling this project, I tried googling other faces to see how others tried doing glasses on people or animals. I wasn't able to get any results so I decided to figure out the best I could. First, I made the face. I borrowed a lot of this code from the bear project I made months ago but added extra touches with the eyes, nose, and mouth. The mouth was recycled code from the stay puft marshmallow man awhile ago. When it came time to the classes, I tried glass classes in different places in the HTML, but found it was better putting the classes above the eyes. I used a test green circle to see if I could get the illusion of glasses. Once I changed the background to transparent and put a black border, the glasses began to take shape. The face is too wide and I need to change around the CSS to make things a lot more cleaner, but I'm satisfied with this project.

### Day 94: November 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a panda critter for Daily CSS Images challenge. Add div tag to mascot index file.

**Thoughts** I looked back at the project I made yesterday and realized I made a CSS selector for a head class when there wasn't a class located in the index file. I added a div class head to the index file. Most of today's work was on the next image for the Daily CSS Images. I tried replicating the panda style on my cell phone case which is a very basic look with. I had the most fun trying to create different shapes for the nose and eyes. The challenge was just trying to find the spacing between the elements. I had trouble finding the right spacing as I kept the elements in the same alignment.

### Day 95: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Add HTML and content to mobile services and events website for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge.

**Thoughts** Decided to try replicating the sample site included in the email. The format is similar but the content is different. My goal for this project is making rows since this format is similar to a portfolio site I want to build once the challenge is over. I'm a little concerned about the images for this project since they are different sizes and it will be a challenge getting these images to be the same size. I'll see if I can play around with them in the CSS tomorrow and make this possible on my site.

### Day 96: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Add CSS to mobile services and events website for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge.

**Thoughts** Did most of the CSS on the website. I added a bit more HTML to my code, but most of the focus was on the CSS. Most of the big portions of CSS are on the site, but there is lots of tweaking that needs to be done. So far the rows are mashing up together instead of being separate on each line. The footer isn't staying in the right place with the blue background up higher than the actual text. I'm going to play with the width, height, margins, and padding for elements. I found a temporary solution for the images by just setting the height of all the images, but I get a feeling I'll have to do even more customization to get the images to be align and similar in size.

### Day 97: November 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Debug some of issues with mobile services and events website for 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge. Began changing HTML & CSS code for project.

**Thoughts** I did lots of debugging for this project. I used developer tools to figure out why some of the images were being a problem on the browser and trying to be in the middle of the site. I think this is due to the way the grid system on my site works. I tried changing some of the measurements for the margins, height, and padding. This didn't work and did nothing when I looked at everything on my site. I finally decided to redo some of the HTML to see where the problem is. So far I managed to fix most of the site. My second navigation and footer are way too far from the rest of the content, creating a large white gap on the page. I did save my original code to my code file. I'm hoping to wrap this up tomorrow.

### Day 98: November 22, 2017

**Today's Progress** Debug final issues for mobile services and events site for 30 Days, 30 sites challenge.

**Thoughts** Finally finished my mobile services site. I wanted to play with the margins on this project to see if that would help with some of the elements on my site. It helped a little bit. I think most of the problem comes from the float property set in some of the grid tags. When I removed the float property from the full width and half width classes, more problems were created. I found the negative margins, while the not best practice, worked for this situation. I'll see if I can find a better solution later with this project in the future.

### Day 99: November 23, 2017

**Today's Progress** Made a HTML & CSS turkey for Daily CSS Images challenge.

**Thoughts** I looked at a few sample projects to see if I could find a live turkey to replicate, but I settled for a roast turkey instead. This turkey was surprisingly hard to make. Originally all the elements for this project were anywhere but on the turkey. I had to double check my code twice and I wasn't able to find the errors even when I comment sections to edit and check parts of my site. I eventually figured out the problem after redoing each selector in my style sheet. It turns out one of the CSS properties had an ; instead of a : which threw off everything in my code.
