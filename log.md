# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a bear cub image from the Daily CSS Images challenge and playing around how to build images in CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's not as it looks. Had to refer back to the Koala example a bit for review and discovered some bugs. Fix those errors in the Koala code when I finished the bear cub code. Not quite sure if it looks like a bear cub, but it is still pretty cute.

### Day 2: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a elephant image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Used CSS to try building trunk

**Thoughts**: This one was so hard because of the trunk. I played around with the trunk and looked at a few examples, but decided to keep things simple. I added the stripes to see if it would help make it interesting. I did my best with the ears, but I might have made Mickey Mouse instead of an elephant. Played with the border-radius a bit to see if that would help and it make it less Mickey a bit.

### Day 3: August 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a Beaver image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Tried building a snout and teeth.

**Thoughts** I tried doing this challenge mostly on my own, but I looked at the code I previously did for reference. I even had to google some projects to see how others tried making the teeth and snout. It took some time, but I managed to get it to work a bit. Hardest part of the challenge was the snout and nose. I tried clippy as suggested from the tools in the online course the creator of the challenge recommends, but it didn't work for me so I just modified it with CSS.

### Day 4: August 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a tiger CSS image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Built the head, ears, eyes, and nose on my own.

**Thoughts** I did a little bit better than the beaver challenge and did most of the things on my own. I did reference back to the beaver a bit for the nose. I did have to look at other project examples to see how others did the stripes. I used on project as an example and tried to replicate it as best I could. Originally it was looking like a bright orange monkey, but the stripes helped make it a little bit better.

### Day 5: August 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS image of Mickey Mouse for the Daily CSS Images challenge. Used a sample project on CodePen to figure out how to do the mouth.

**Thoughts** Wasn't quite sure what to do for the challenge so I had to look at other projects to get an idea what I was suppose to do. Decided to make Mickey Mouse since I almost made a mouse yesterday. Overall did better building Mickey's head and ears. The biggest challenge was the smile and creating his chin. I did a quick google search to see how others made smiles and tweaked some of the code to get mine for Mickey. It doesn't quite look like Mickey Mouse. His cheeks have a chipmunk quality, but overall I was impressed with what I was able to do and make.

### Day 6: August 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a CSS Clock from CSS Tricks. Finished HTML and CSS. Trying to get clock to work once it is in the browser.

**Thoughts** I looked at more examples of clocks before started this project so decided to "cheat" and try using a tutorial. I found one off of CSS Tricks and decided to try it. I've made clocks before, but this one involves moving the different hands on the clock. Currently working on getting the hands to work. Right now the minute hand stays where it is at.

### Day 7: August 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS Clock Code so clock hands work. Started working on Day 7 of CSS Images with the ruler image.

**Thoughts** I debugged my code for my clock I was working on yesterday. The problem was with the images and how the URL being used in the CSS. Once that was fixed, the code was running smoothly. Once I finished with the clock code, I started working on the CSS ruler. The challenge was figuring out the markings on the ruler and how to get them to appear on the page. I looked a quite a few examples and decided to try replicating one I saw on a website I googled. The problem I had with the ruler was just getting the markings to line with each other. Some were separated from the top. When I used ruler-wrapper for the class, the issue was resolved. I'll play around with the customization sometime later.

### Day 8: August 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Made a notepad for Day 8 of Daily CSS Images Challenge.

**Thoughts** Once again, looked at some of the CSS Images of notepads on CodePen to get some inspiration before I started. Decided to try replicating some of the code I've seen on CodePen. I had to google a bit of the code to understand how it works, but I managed to get my version similar to the one I was working off of on CodePen. Will try the next challenge tomorrow then switch gears and maybe try Odin Project a bit.

### Day 9: August 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a calendar for Day 8 of Daily CSS Images Challenge. Use the tutorial on W3schools.com to make a monthly calendar.

**Thoughts** I wanted to make a simple calendar so I did some googling before I decided to build this project. I found this tutorial on W3schoools and decided to try making it with them. Overall it was a better experience making this project. Will be switching from Daily CSS Images to projects on Odin Project tomorrow to see how those go before returning to the Daily CSS Image challenge. All that is left to do for this project is play with the fonts and colors.

### Day 10: August 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on election map for Skillcrush 102 review. Started to debug code.

**Thoughts** I did start Odin Project, but there wasn't enough project building for me to write a post for today and I didn't want to jump ahead with Odin so I worked on the election map bonus project from the updated Skillcrush 102. This map was already a work in progress before I did this challenge so most of the code was already done. I just added more variables, objects, and methods to figure out the state winners. Did some work on debugging my code and did find some errors. I will continue debugging code to see if I can find the error later. JavaScript itself is tough for me and this challenge was tough for that reason. I still need some JavaScript practice so hopefully I can push through the Odin Project more tomorrow.

### Day 11: August 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started building a portfolio for 30 Days, 30 Sites Challenge. Built most of site. Adding more customizations and changing colors.

**Thoughts** Still working on getting Odin Project ready to go, but there are some extra things I need to do before I can start doing the projects. In the mean time, I'm trying out the 30 Days, 30 Sites challenge by doing the portfolio (the first project). I looked at the sample site and tried out the sample site code to see how they did parts of the site. After working on that code, I'm taking the things I liked about the site and translating it to my own portfolio site. This is a newer version of my previous portfolio site so I'm playing with the colors and layout a bit more. There are some things I liked from the sample site that I'm going to keep using, but I'm slowly making changes to the site to have it fit my personality a bit more.  I'm still working on my site right now. I'll try playing with it a bit more and finish up this site tomorrow.

### Day 12: August 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Putting finishing touches on portfolio site from Day 11. Started working on event invitation for 30 Days, 30 Sites Challenge.

**Thoughts** Added some last minute final touches to the portfolio site I was working on for Day 11 and added the link to the log. Spent most of my time building an event invitation. I looked at the sample site and the one on W3schools to see how to tackle this project. After looking at the demo and the code for the demo a bit, I started picking and choosing which elements I wanted for my site on CodePen. Currently working on getting just the right header for my website. I couldn't get the background image to appear at first, then when it did appear I didn't like the look with a text. I'm going to keep things simple and just use simple background colors with the text.

### Day 13: August 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished working on event invitation project for Day 12. Debugging code for Election Map and Magic 8 Ball for Skillcrush 102 review.

**Thoughts** Worked a little bit more on the event invitation project form Day 12. Changed the images, added some colors, and tweaked some of the content. The project isn't perfect, but I'm much happier with the look. I might go back and change colors of the headlines so they work with the images. Instead of starting a new project, I took time go get back to debug my magic 8 ball code and election map code I've been working on for the Skillcrush 102 review I'm doing with a few other Skillcrush alumni. With the magic 8 ball, I tweaked some of the functions and manage to get the message to appear. The only thing I need to do know for the magic 8 ball is figure out how to get the message inside the actual magic 8 ball. I double checked all my code, but wasn't able to figure out what was causing it to act up. I took a break and went back to the election map. This time I was able to get all the states to change colors, showing the candidate names, and picking a winner. The only problem was the colors belonging to the second candidate weren't showing up on the map. I think the problem is in one of the functions so I'll need to double check the JavaScript again to see if I can find the error.

### Day 14: August 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a pencil jar for Daily CSS Images challenge. Used CSS to add a few pencils inside the jar.

**Thoughts** Decided to do another CSS images for today's project. I found it helpful when I look at other examples on CodePen since it gives me a better idea of what I need to make. After looking at a couple of examples, I picked one I liked and tried replicating the code as best as I could. The biggest challenge was making the pencils. One of the pencils was outside of the jar so it took me some time playing top margin, width, and height to get the pencil in the jar.
