# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a bear cub image from the Daily CSS Images challenge and playing around how to build images in CSS.

**Thoughts:** It's not as it looks. Had to refer back to the Koala example a bit for review and discovered some bugs. Fix those errors in the Koala code when I finished the bear cub code. Not quite sure if it looks like a bear cub, but it is still pretty cute.

### Day 2: August 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Built a elephant image from the Daily CSS Images challenge. Used CSS to try building trunk

**Thoughts**: This one was so hard because of the trunk. I played around with the trunk and looked at a few examples, but decided to keep things simple. I added the stripes to see if it would help make it interesting. I did my best with the ears, but I might have made Mickey Mouse instead of an elephant. Played with the border-radius a bit to see if that would help and it make it less Mickey a bit.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
